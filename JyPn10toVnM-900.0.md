By natural selection, there is a tendency to select against animals with broad food tastes because they are exposed to so many mutagens—things which split chromosomes and damage genetic material. However, if you're faced with extinction, your back is already to the wall. You can see the grim reaper drawing near. At that point, expanding your diet becomes a perfectly credible strategy for survival.

This is what happened to these formerly arboreal apes who descended onto the grasslands. They began to experiment with their diet. In addition to the fruit they had always eaten, they began to eat insects. They became carnivores and began to evolve a hunting style. I've personally observed the food-testing behavior of baboons in Kenya, and I assume it is very analogous to the behavior of early proto-hominids. A baboon will approach a potential food source, sniff it, look at it, place it in its mouth but not swallow—sometimes for as much as a minute—and then either spit it out or swallow a small amount and wait. If there's no immediate negative feedback like vomiting, a burning throat, or constriction, the food will begin to be accepted.

This grassland was nutritionally sparse; there wasn't an overabundance of food. However, a parallel evolutionary event was occurring alongside primate evolution: the rise of various large ungulate mammals—primitive cattle, gazelle-type animals, wildebeests, and other hooved animals. Many congregated in herds, which represented the major concentration of available protein in the environment. Killing a two or three hundred-pound animal provided more nutrition than several hundred acres of gathering corms or raiding anthills. The pressure was intense to become carnivores and focus on these ungulate mammals. Quite naturally, this led to a kind of nomadic pastoralism based on following these large herds.

Other large and efficient carnivores were also on the scene—the equivalent of today's lions, saber-toothed tigers, and panthers. Many evolutionary biologists believe the suppression of our sense of smell is due to a phase where we predated on carrion. It's not a pleasant thought, but we may have let lions do the work, then driven them from fresh kills with sticks and rocks to eat the available meat. Since it was often ripe, there was pressure to suppress olfactory sensitivity. Another school of thought believes our bipedal gait, which lifted our nose off the ground, led to the atrophy of our olfactory senses. These two theories compete.

Whatever the cause, there was intense interest in these large herds of ungulate mammals as a central protein source—not just from large cat predators, but also from wild dogs, timber wolves, dingoes, jackals, and hyenas. A consequence of these large herds is plenty of manure, which is the favorite medium for certain kinds of dung-loving (coprophilic or coprolitic) mushrooms.

Based on my observations of baboons in Kenya, I've seen them approach cow pies and flip them over to look for grubs and beetle larvae. They understand manure is a vector for insect protein. However, by a marvelous coincidence (or superb planning), these same cow pies are also the preferred medium for coprophilic mushrooms, particularly Stropharia cubensis—a pandemic species I've seen in the Amazon the size of dinner plates. After a rain, you see them by the hundreds, vectored on the same cow pies the baboons forage. By design or destiny, the mushroom was placed directly in the path of foraging proto-hominids and would certainly have been tested for its food value.

Aside from containing psilocybin, Stropharia cubensis is delicious when fresh. "Delicious" is just a monkey's way of saying it's good food; if you find something delicious, you will overrule almost all other signals to eat it.

So, what are the consequences of including a psychoactive compound like psilocybin in the human diet? I believe a simple three-stage process answers the question about the origin of human cognition, value systems, and language.

The first consequence for a foraging, hungry proto-hominid is an increase in visual acuity. This isn't widely known, as psilocybin is called a hallucinogen, but I'm talking about low doses. Roland Fisher, a physiologist at the NIH in the early '60s, gave psilocybin to thousands and studied its effect on vision. Using an apparatus with two parallel bars that could be skewed, he showed that people on low doses could detect the misalignment much more quickly than those given a placebo. He stated this was a case where a drug actually gives you better information about reality.

While this may have no consequence in a psychology lab, visual acuity is the thread by which life and death are hung for foraging primates. In that context, psilocybin acts like chemical binoculars. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to see that having chemical binoculars in a hunting situation makes you a more effective hunter. On this first, unconscious level, proto-hominids who accepted psilocybin had a slightly enhanced probability of survival through a better food supply. This is the first level on which its use would be selected for.

As we all know, there's more to psilocybin than increased visual acuity. At slightly higher levels, still well below...

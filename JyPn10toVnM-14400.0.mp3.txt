and all those people are willing to say this is not based on science this is based on the experience of meeting the management on the other side of science the earth is some kind of conscious intellect key and it is managing itself toward an end we are embedded in a plan we are not a breakaway mutation we are a desperate response to something and what was going on back there in the high paleolithic was on a very regular basis human beings in this nomadic hunter gatherer situation were taking mushrooms together as a religious ritual there were dissolving boundaries this is what we experience when we take psilocybin the generalized description of the psychedelic experience is it dissolves boundaries and the main boundary that it was dissolving and that it does dissolve is the ego psychedelics are an inoculation against selfishness at the expense of group values and it is selfishness at the expense of group values that is shoving us toward Armageddon these pastoralist mushroom taking goddess worshipping equilibrium partnership societies were the solution to the human problem they had achieved a kind of dynamosis that we can only envy they were fully minded their thoughts were deeper than our thoughts their poetry was richer than our poetry they didn't build things they didn't have a demonic relationship to matter because because every new and full moon they were taking mushrooms and jumping on each other in a big heap and this was making it impossible to trace male paternity and so care of children was generalized it was a group phenomenon and so then what happened if it was so wonderful what the hell happened well again no blame no blame what happened was that the very processes that created this perfect world which were a process of gradual drying of the African continent to force these monkeys out of the trees and into this grassland symbiotic pastoral nomadic adaptation that drying process continued and the grass dried up and the water holes got further and further apart and the mushroom festivals were no longer held every Saturday night they were held once a month and then at the solstices and equinoxes and then at the solstice and then every ten years and then never and the other thing that was going on was there was frantic pressure to try and figure out how to preserve the mushrooms since they were so hard to get and the only solution anybody could come up with was honey and honey is a material which left to itself in that kind of an environment will turn into me and mead is an alcoholic beverage and the difference between a psilocybin coke and an alcoholic beverage is the difference between church and North Beach so around around 9,500 years ago it wouldn't work in Africa anymore it was insupportable and these people began moving out into the Nile Valley and what is now Palestine and if you know anything about the archaeology of the Nile you know that before this the stratigraphy is basically empty even he slays the cosmic bull then he goes to the shaman figure Enkidu and against his will he puts big pressure on Enkidu to go with him into the wilderness and there they cut down the tree of life this is what they do this is what Gilgamesh does this is the first act of the first man in the first moment of the story of Western civilization out into the woods to chop down the tree of life meanwhile the semi their story is a story of history's first drug bust you know this woman finds this plant the caretaker of the garden has put up signs which say don't eat this plant she eats it and the shit hits the fan and I recommend to you a thorough reading of Genesis it's astonishing what's going on there here we have Yawa after this little contra camp has taken place Yawa he's wandering around in the garden he speaks don't ask me to who he speaks and he says if they eat of the fruit of the tree of life they will become as we are this this can't fly so the issue is everybody perceives the issue the same Adam Eve and Yawa the tension is over the fact that there would be equality if the plant knowledge were fully available and it's clear that it comes through the woman I think that women were the custodians of language I think language was a woman's mystery the again looking at it from a point of view of evolutionary stress the evolutionary stress on men was to be the stoic silent hunter to be able to hold a hunting position in a game drive for hours and women stayed closer to home because they had children hanging off them they had a different physical constituency and they were in charge of the gathering part of the hunter-gatherer equation well gathering is about is essentially the art of description it's the small bush with the silver leaves at the bottom of the Arroyo near the black rock with the gray scratch across it now you have to have your language skills down you have to be able to describe hundreds of plants and their parts and where they're located and how to separate them and how to prepare them and what part of year is important and so forth and so on and this repertoire of detail was what women had and what created them their power in this goddess mushroom ambiance the thing that I've learned in studying history and living life is that the thing that makes you happy eventually makes you unhappy everything flows nothing lasts and this is a hard truth to come to grips with psychedelic or otherwise nothing lasts nothing lasts not even yourself and what failed for the archaic world was the cleverness of women evolved into the potential understanding of agriculture they had this vast repertoire of understanding of plants but when they abstracted it and generalized it they realized this we just need to utilize what we know about these six plants and forget all this other stuff and lean hard on these six plants well but then everything is you know you're not gathering now you're setting plow to the earth you're wounding the earth and you know from there to this moment it's just the blink of an eye it's that wonderful camera dissolve in 2001 where the bone is thrown into the air and as it comes down it turns into a space station in orbit around the earth the rest is history as they say history is the story of the cancerous and unchecked growth of the ego its institutions its structures its stratagems its ploys it's worked every single angle and I I think that monotheism is appealing philosophically as a certain economy one God you know that wraps it up nicely but you know you've got to be a little more subtle than that let's take a Jungian perspective for a moment our gods are the images that we collectively empower ourselves to emulate and if our God is omnipotent omniscient never wrong always right utterly unforgiving this is a jerk who needs this we don't need this our image of deity is pathological our image of deity is the image of the cancerously untamed ego and until we do something about this we haven't got the prayer of a snowball in hell exhortation is not going to do it and now time is running out time is running out it was not for nothing that this psychedelic surge occurred in the 60s this the human story is not going to be allowed the luxury of being a comedy you know what a comedy is a comedy is when you've got no choice this is going to be a tragedy because the cards are on the table you know if you drown because this boat is sinking it's because you didn't bother to wander over and climb in the lifeboat that's the kind of situation we're in by analyzing the archaic context which was the last sane moment this species ever knew so what that it was 15,000 years ago it's a blink of an eye no we've been ill since then now let's fix it the last sane moment we ever knew and then comes the cascade of history history is an absolute nightmare and it can only be redeemed by us this is this thing about the Dow of the ancestors you know did all these people get freezed to death and stomped on by mastodons and eaten by saber-toothed tigers and ravaged by disease so you can blow it you with your Mercedes and your 48 foot television set it can't be that lame you know so so then how does one what is to be done right the Tolstoyan question what is to be done is it a political program is it what is it yeah I don't think it is that I think that that the way the psychedelic thing works is you must establish a level of authenticity in yourself these are the reality and then you become a walking social catalyst regulator mean generator whatever you want to put it it's it's authentic understanding without ideology this is it psychedelics are not an ideology psychedelics are an experience I mean you can have the psychedelic experience without taking drugs it's just that you know you have to drive your car a hundred miles an hour over a 300 foot cliff and live you know and then you come out of that ready to talk turkey you know we lose too many people that way because you see what we're in is serious denial I mean the capacity of the Western mind for denial of the predicament is just mind-boggling I mean here we are calmly discussing the clock is ticking and we're sitting on a planet stuffed full of thermonuclear bombs disease delivery systems craze Oh politicians psychopaths at every organizational level propaganda machine running wild and we intellectuals calmly gather to again consult Tolstoy consult this consultant try and figure it out the level of denial is pretty incredible and you know I think we have to go back to the 60s to see why that's the case it's because we're very much afraid the issue around psychedelics both both collectively and personally if you're doing them right is surrender you know if you're doing them right it scares you to death how much you do because you do so much that you lose control that's the thing control is the issue always and everywhere and we've got this scene so controlled that you know we're on the brink of Armageddon behind control how can it be very very carefully deconstructed well I think the first thing is we have to open

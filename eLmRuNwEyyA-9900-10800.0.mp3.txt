The population of the earth would be cut in half in 50 years 50 years following that it would be cut in half again 50 years after that in half again in 150 years the population of the earth could be under a billion people Nobody was shot No wars were fought. No one was told they could not have a child No one was coerced. No one was starved Then I started looking into this thing about children and population and most of you like me probably imagined that the world has a population problem and this population problem is going on in places like Pakistan and Bangladesh because dag nabbit those little brown people will just not stop having children Well, I looked into it and I've got a surprise for you and America a child born in America will use between 600 and 1,000 times More natural resources and energy than a child born to a woman in Bangladesh suppose you went to Bangladesh and you met a woman a young woman of childbearing age and she Told you that her ambition in life was to have a thousand children You'd be appalled. I mean what kind of social responsibility is this? What kind of person are you that you want to do this? an American woman having one child is Having the equivalent of those thousand infants now in another interesting thing about this Suggestion made by the mushroom that each woman should rear one Natural child when we think of population control schemes the first objection is My god, you can never sell this to people. They have these religions. They have these centuries of tradition and so forth It just won't wash Notice that what the mushroom suggested is most likely to be accepted by the person most important to convert We don't want to convert the women of the back streets of Bangladesh to this policy We want to convert the women of Sherman Oaks, Malibu, Santa Monica gross point Boston, New York, Philadelphia Because these are the women whose children are using the resources So here is in one sentence The mushroom was able to answer a question. I put to it with a suggestion. I had never dreamed of That seems at first glance anyway to stand up pretty well And I've spent a lifetime trying to figure out ways to solve human problems. See we're a little stupid because we're all alike and something years ago the mushroom said to me which deals with this was people are always This question of enlightenment and the mushroom said for one human being to expect to obtain Enlightenment from another is like a grain of sand on the beach Expecting to attain enlightenment from another grain of sand on the beach. Don't you get it? You're all grains of sand. I mean Joe Schmoe who runs a body shop and Mukta Ruby Baba are the same people there There's no difference between those two guys. No reason to assume. So So I think we need help and that little exercise in what do you do about the population problem shows that there are? Suggestions out there. We haven't thought of avenues. We haven't tried When I thought about why haven't we tried to this avenue of one woman one natural child it took me about 30 seconds to understand that it's real hard to make a buck in a situation when population is Retracting at a rate of 50% per generation and our whole world is based on making a buck I told this idea to someone and they said but if the women of Malibu stop having children They will lose all their political power because political power is numerical This is not true political power is power and if the women of Malibu stop having children They will be quite a bit wealthier than they already are notice that this Deciding to voluntarily have one natural child is also very helpful to you personally that a Woman will have to work less hard We'll have to cut fewer deals with the in-place structure of male dominance if she has only one child a Woman with two children has got to cut a deal with male dominance or she has a trust fund or something The reason we are I think instinct that we have a tendency to clench at this suggestion and not follow it through Is because we imagine that there is something holy and sacred about the nuclear family and that we don't want to attack this Biological unit that has such integrity But this is a bunch of nonsense. The nuclear family has no biological integrity whatsoever It's a creation of the post-industrial Reformation the extended family is the natural human unit to ease the pressure of child rearing on young Women and to give everybody the benefit of contact Intergenerational contact and so forth. No this nuclear family that our Politicians are always beating their breasts about is the absolute cauldron of neurosis in this society as far as I can see and when you look at the Demographics of what is happening the number of women with one the number of households that are one woman one child Household, I think you can see that maybe our unconscious has already been in communication with the mushroom And it's just the ego who's going to get the news Last well, I don't want to spend too much time on that but it's an example of how these things offer solutions to human problems and if it can offer solutions to a human problem like Overpopulation by six billion people on a planet Then it can surely take care of the needs of and concerns of a group of rainforest hunter-gatherers That number 70 or so people I doubt they can conceive of a question But it doesn't have an answer to because it can operate on many levels Simultaneously and this is an example of Consciousness in action you see me plus nothing had nothing new to say about the population problem me plus psilocybin had a whole new take a Suggestion we can swat it down and ultimately decide it's a bunch of malarkey But at least there was a new thought a new try a new. Hope this is the consequences of Consciousness and we're beset by Problems like this and we shouldn't assume that they are insoluble simply because we haven't solved them in fact We must assume that they are soluble or else We are not going to have a place to hang our hat in 50 years but we the the solutions come through an act of humility an act of opening to the dynamic of Nature the feminine the psyche the ego is the calcareous Knot of tumorous tissue that stands outside of all that and cannot be trusted and cannot be relied upon and so by attempting to dissolve that to to Mitigate its hard edges to smooth it out into the greater Context of being then we really discover What humanness is about because humanness is not something that can be encompassed From the point of view of the ego. That's why having created the ultimately egoistic Society we've created a society with so little humanity in it you know and I See the psychedelics as a siren song Calling us back to what is authentic to what is real and To what instead of closing off our future options begins to open them up so that we can see that You know Human beings are a part of the larger Universal destiny and we can comport ourselves with grace and dignity and Make the world a better place than we found it, which is certainly not our record so far But it's not too late. I mean HG Wells called history a race between education and disaster It's not mere coincidence nor even mere Unicity that at this moment in time and space with these tremendous crises Bearing down upon us that we have reached out to the archaic peoples With a new attitude not an attitude of how can we enslave them? But how can we learn from? My hope is that here in the final ticking of the clock of History we are going to end our prodigal descent into the desert world of the ego and Return with what we have learned the fruits of the prodigal journeying of the errant Sun Which is what history has been Return with the fruits of that prodigal wandering to the larger human family that waits on Us in the rainforests in the deserts in the marshes in the thorn forests of this planet The archaic people are waiting for us to get on the train and then the train will be able to depart but we have to awaken to our past and Then we can set a course toward a meaningful future That's the wrap basically So, let me explain something The DMT flash is very brief The mushroom experience is very long hours Hours you can if you are Fortunate and took enough on a psilocybin trip you can work your way Into a place which looks like a DMT flash But it will take you a couple of hours of breath control and sitting in darkness and paying attention To get to this place So I wanted to make clear that for my money These hallucinogens all pretty much lead into the same place But the experience of psilocybin and DMT is very different If only because one is tremendously gradual, although it may not seem like that when it's happening But compared to DMT, it's very gradual it unfolds over several hours while the other you know You measure the DMT flash in hundreds of seconds. I mean it is a flash For sure Okay I'll just make my way through these and we'll do as many as we have time for and I guess we'll go till about four a recent LA Times magazine article on Mayan excavation made passing reference to hallucinogenic enemas Any knowledge of such practice? Good question and humorous Enemas were invented By the New World Indians strangely enough. They were it was a route of drug administration Unknown to Roman or Greek Medicine the reason the people of the Amazon Basin invented enemas Two reasons really first of all, they had these very strong corrosive drugs that they wanted to find a route of administration for And and the second reason was they had rubber The South American forests are the source of rubber So they invented the first enema the first hot water bottle and God knows what else Decency should probably not even inquire I've never I've never taken a hallucinogenic enema, but in principle it may not be a bad idea In principle it may not be a bad idea with some things that are very Sickening or or like that if you do an enema though Remember that you cut doses to one third You don't do a full dose that way or you'll leave a human shaped hole in the roof Uh Once the European contact began enemas became just a fad in Europe and they were even doing tobacco smoke enemas At one point which is really weird Okay Please explain, uh I guess it says propagation an appropriate dosage of betel nuts and kava I don't know too much about betel nuts. That's piper beetle It's a vice throughout southeast asia. You probably all know the song from south pacific bloody mary

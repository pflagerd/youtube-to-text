tremendous shaping force on the social psychology of of the primates I believe that Everything about us that is noble and worth saving Occurs against the grain That if we had followed the grain we would still be Competing with jackals for the carcasses left by lions of large game kills on the plains of Africa But when the African continent began to dry up and we were forced out of the trees Where we had an arboreal vegetarian lifestyle we came under great pressure to expand our diet and The I believe that the great unstudied Factor in human evolution and human emergence is the effect of a complex diet on our emerging species and it's not only the presence of hallucinogens such as Psilocybin in the in the diet, but other things as well Psilocybin is the most spectacular case and you know if you came to see Darwin you'd have to hear about Evolution so you came to see me so you have to hear this little theory about human Emergence that most of you can probably recite it by heart now But it's a three-step it's a three-step feedback loop from a fairly bright monkey to a fairly stupid human being and The way it works like this these monkeys come down out of the trees. They're Predating on on kills of ungulate mammals made by lions They're competing with jackals they're testing all the foods in the environment and Lo and behold in the manure of these ungulate mammals that are irradiating across the African continent there are what are called coprophytic mushrooms and the Presence of large amounts of tryptophan in manure as a substrate means that these coprophytic mushrooms Elaborate Psilocybin. So here in this new grassland environment are the Psilocybin mushrooms. Well these Proto-hominid creatures Testing foods for their diet would reach the Psilocybin and would test it Well, then this three-part feedback loop to humanness then comes into play and it works like this very very light doses of Psilocybin So light that you cannot an hour and a half or two hours later tell you've taken anything Say I don't feel it. I feel completely normal I must not have taken enough that dose if you would submit yourself to being tested by an Optometric Apparatus we could show you that your vision has improved slightly This is an effect of eating small amounts of psychoactive amines Increase of visual acuity. Well, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to know that if you're a hunting animal Competing in a highly competitive environment and suddenly somebody hands you a pair of chemical binoculars You are going to be a more successful hunter than other members of your Species who are not availing themselves of this food item. So there was reinforcement there Aha, if we eat these mushrooms in small amounts, we will be more successful hunters Or maybe it was never raised to consciousness as an if-then Relationship, it was just we eat mushrooms. We hunt. Well kind of thing Then If you eat slightly more of the psilocybin if you bring slightly more of it into your diet It's what's called a CNS Stimulator central nervous system stimulant an effect of all CNS stimulants is what's called Arousal and arousal means simply that you can't sit still You're very restless You're very energetic and often in the male animal you have an erection. It's an overall systemic arousal arousal and if you if you Give if you witness this situation in monkeys monkeys are very hang loose kind of characters And so then they just all fall together in a heap and make love and this Increases what anthropologists and primatologists like to call successful instances of copulation this means that this increased in interest in sex in combination with an increased success in obtaining food is Creating the perfect situation in which there will be a population boom of these creatures They're eating better and they're enjoying themselves more and they have better relationships with each other So population boom is on the way Well, then the next and final level is when you raise the dose higher So you're no longer restless or interested in sex or anything, but you're flattened with the ecstatic Unfolding of the full numinous hallucinogenic rupture of plane then and this occurs, you know in the tribal context then there is boundary dissolution Group sexual activity and group bonding and identification and this is where this telepathic coherence this inner dynamic of Cohesion and caring that we see in primitive people to some small degree and that we imagine Must once have been our birthright. This is where it came to be and at those higher levels of psilocybin Most of you probably know language is formed by an organ on one side of the brain called Broca's area Broca's area the brain being always Symmetrically constructed Broca's area has a twin on the opposite side of the brain, but no one knows what's going on there It's apparently a silent area of the brain. Well when you take psilocybin, there is spontaneous linguistic activity Henry Munn has written about this in his essay the mushrooms of language. It's almost as though psilocybin is a pheromone that promotes linguistic activity an effort to take verbal intentionality and Connected up to the on toasts of being in some way and then it's almost as though Words are born out of you you give birth to words and These concrescences of meaning then create a kind of unitary ambiance, which we call Understanding language is a miracle. I mean make no mistake about it I don't think any amount of dissection of monkeys or human cadavers will give you any insight Into language language is a behavior of some sort so bizarre So many orders of magnitude more complex than anything else we do that for all practical purposes This is the thumbprint of God upon creation human language and it's a self Transforming thing it keeps bootstrapping itself to higher and higher levels and it creates for us the entire ambiance of Reality once we had words We quickly replaced reality with them And so I'm I believe that what psilocybin promotes is cognitive activity the coordination of visual input with plans and strategies for hunting or acquisition or whatever it promotes this increased arousal which really in a way We as moderns are Absolutely as in all of as our mushroom munching ancestors 25,000 years ago. We can't reduce it. We don't know what it is You know Jung was always so concerned that people say it's only Psychological it's only the psyche. I've got news for you it may only be the psyche, but the psyche is all there is and As as we came into a relationship with the mushroom humanness emerged on the African belt and was able to stabilize itself for a few millennia and then We fell into history because of climatological change for many reasons But we literally fell into history and now we operate in this lower domain a domain of limitation of misunderstanding of low-grade languages But the can and we are neurotic we are unhappy We are dysfunctional and I believe this is because our connection to the logos To the informing voice that gives meaning to being Has been broken over 10,000 years it's fallen away and all we're left with is our spiritual yearnings our nostalgia for paradise and our our pathologies and Miraculously, we are left with the time capsule of preservation represented by the rainforest shamanic cultures that use hallucinogens There lies our answer, but it's like the oroboric serpent Taking its tail in its mouth The the salvation of the super future of the planet lies in a recovery of the values modalities and religious practices of 25 to 50 thousand years ago Break break break And we haven't screened the pile so we're just going to go through them and I'll read them aloud and Normally, I give long answers, but there's such a stack of questions here. I'll try and be general meal Or general brief and keep it me Since DMT is present in the brain does the introduction of excess DMT Shut down the production of natural DMT in the way that the body stops producing Opiates during opium usage if so, what are the effects is DMT really so perfectly chemically benign? the first point to make is that Many of your questions cannot be answered because research into these areas is not allowed so often We can't answer your question this question. Does the introduction of excess DMT Limit endogenous production I can say with fair confidence that that's never been studied My guess would be that it does not Because the DMT isn't in no sense of the word. Do you become habituated to DMT? I mean a person who does DMT once a year is a fanatically heavy user I would say and And the question is DMT really so chemically benign Again, this has not been studied the way you would study with rats and so forth to determine it, but Experientially speaking the amazing thing about DMT is the speed with which you return to normal You return to the baseline of consciousness in under 10 minutes Well that tells you that the brain is very well able to deal with this compound one way of judging How toxic a drug or a plant is is to ask yourself the question how long after I take it do I feel completely normal and With DMT you feel completely normal 15 minutes after taking it. It's the shortest recovery time of any Drug This question is concerning the bundle weed while it does not directly meet the criteria of long-term use Is it to be considered safe? I'd say the way to answer that question is to do a chemical analysis of the bundle weed if there's nothing Present but DMT in it. I would think it should be considered safe now There may be other compounds present in South America It's possible to contrast two plants psychotria viridis which has almost entirely nothing in it except DMT as the portion of its alkaloid fraction or varroa varroa cathagenesis, which is used in the making of snuff and Chemically, it's a mess. It looks like they swept the floor You've got nn DMT 5 me o DMT alpha methyl tryptamine monomethyltryptamine 6 hydroxyl methyl tryptamine all of this this you don't want you want a narrow Surgical strike on the synapse is what you're going for not Splattering all kinds of junk all over the place What is the best medium for psilocybin spore germination potato agar or what the best

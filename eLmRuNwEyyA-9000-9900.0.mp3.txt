central to the Amanita muscaria cult because reindeer Eat the mushroom and then excrete their urine and this is thought to be a cleaner and easier way to take the mushroom Than to take it on the so-called first pass. The second pass is after the reindeer have had you know just an anecdotal aside if you're ever in the Yakut Basin one of the great perils of the intoxicated Amanita user is to crawl out of the yurt in the middle of the night to take a leak in the snow and Before you can back off the reindeer come and knock you headlong Because they want to get to this Amanita flavored snow So here is Santa Claus Right in the center of our culture and when you take it apart All the motifs are there the demon artificers the elves the cosmic axis the magical flight It's a beautiful example of the preservation of pagan psychedelic use into a modern context Oh, what can we say about this? Oh Well, I know the one thing one more thing I wanted to say about it That this program that these tykes are pushing is a language skills Program and we don't know how long people have been bursting into this place. This may be The source of language, you know, how did where did language come from? We learned it from elves in hyperspace. This is as good a possibility as any other and This is still ongoing this language reformation program they want us to activate our language forming ability and Language in the DMT flash as I said this morning, it's something beheld Syntax is something potentially to be looked at not to be heard and We don't understand this because for us language is something that you hear We can't imagine a language that you see But have you ever noticed the way in which we preserve clarity of intention in Language with verbal metaphors. We say I see what you mean He painted a picture. It means we unconsciously believe that truth will be beheld and Some of you who are students of the ancient literature may know philo judaeus Hellenistic Alexandrine Jew absolute contemporary of Christ born before died after and in one of his treatises on the logos, which he was always talking about philo judaeus Presents an etymology of the word Israel Talking about the word Israel and he says Israel means He who sees God This is the meaning of the word Israel and then he goes on to say This he who sees God he's talking about that and he says what would be the more perfect logos? Now I should assume most of you know The logos was an informing voice a voice in the head, which was the sine qua non of Alexandrian spirituality Socrates had it Plato had it the logos. So philo judaeus asked What would be the more perfect logos and then he answers his own question He says the more part the more perfect logos would go from being beheld I'm sorry would go from being heard to being beheld without ever crossing over a noticeable moment of transition Well, that is precisely what you encounter in deep psychedelic experiences and the DMT flesh you behold the logos in the in the Initiation of the experience you don't behold it you hear it It sounds in Michael Harner's wonderful phrase like the sound of rushing water or like the sound of Tinkling bells and it's very far away and then it begins to come closer You can you can you begin to form a picture of it in your mind the way you would form a picture of a Nepali Marching band if you just heard it about a half mile away and the oompa pa and it's getting bigger Coming closer. This is the elf Parade and when it finally comes into view it actually goes Without ever passing over a noticeable moment of transition from being heard to being seen through the phenomenon of approach You hear it before you see it Then you see it far away Then you see it very close and when you see it very close who cares what it sounds like because you're seeing it This more perfect logos is what the tykes the spiritual helpers want to teach and I think that it's Important to spend a little time on this because I think this would have tremendous historical impact upon our situation if we could by hook or by crook create a More visible logos a language which could be seen You've probably all Considered at some time or another what would telepathy be like and I think most people answer that question by thinking that Telepathy would be for me to hear what you think But how would it be if telepathy were for me to see what you mean? That's telepathy if it puts you in the other guy's shoes if you Stand in the other person's shoes You are the other person to have a person's point of view is to be That person in regard to that single Datum of experience, so I've Spent time with virtual reality people and all these technical folks because I think that Visual language is something that wants to be born and it may be that it is can be Technologically coaxed into existence that we're gonna have to wear goggles and have fast computer or it may be that it can be Physiologically coaxed into existence There may be drugs which shift the processing of language from being an auditory Phenomenon to being a visible phenomenon Ayahuasca is an excellent candidate for this If you spend time with the ayahuasca taking populations in the Amazon There's great stress in these populations on acquiring. What's called an Icaro Icaro means magical song and the Icaro is a spontaneous chant like song which comes to you during the intoxication the thing that's interesting about these Icaros is that they are critiqued as visual objects Not as sound people never say of an Icaro It sounded beautiful They always say it looked Lovely and then people will say but there should have been more blue This kind of thing it's clearly being criticized as a visual modality, well, I think that these ayahuasca using people are at the cutting edge of Evolution they are forcing They are forcing the evolution of the modality of Language it may be that the processing of language is not hardwired not Physiologically wired it's a software function having to do with culture language Upbringing and so forth because some people claim they are great thinkers Because some people claim they are great visualizers and that they do think visually and so forth and we have no reason to deny this So it may be that we are just a one gene or even a an expression of gene ratios difference away from an entirely different way of processing communication between each other and this is what the new age the end of history the Anticipation of this great breakthrough that we can feel but not really outline is About if that seems far-fetched to you You should notice how far-fetched the original emergence of language must have been because I think people were fully people and full and totally mute or you know unable to Articulate a thought and then either an accumulation of neurons or some Synergistic effect was brought into play and lo and behold Spoken language emerged out of that. Well something similar could happen to us in the morning session I talked about the forced Evolution of language paying attention to our language. I really think that the way to think of these psychedelics is as catalysts for the imagination If any of you are chemists, you know a catalyst is Something that when you add it to a chemical process The process is tremendously speeded up But in the end the catalyst is not destroyed. The catalyst is reconstituted at the end so Psychedelics one way of thinking of them is as a catalyst for cognition The original description of psychedelic drugs was they were consciousness Expanding drugs. Well if we take the idea that they are consciousness expanding Seriously for even a moment Then we have to put a lot of attention in on this because it's the absence of consciousness Consciousness that is murdering us and our planet. We need all the consciousness we can get We need to wring it out of computers get it out of plants raise it in ourselves and our children Wherever we can get it we need it and the present You know the present situation with the planet is very dire Very dire because of us our Unchecked evolution in a single direction along the gradient of culture has now created a toxic planet That is an endangered planet Since this situation has arisen entirely within the confines of history Aren't we going to have to look outside of history in order to redress? This problem. I think so and when we do look outside the history Then we find the institution of plant shamanism They're waiting to inform us to educate us and to show us how to set our Course out of the present dilemma. I don't think we can find our way out By ourselves. I don't think we can get high by ourselves And I don't think as a species that we can save this planet by ourselves We have to have a partner we have to Get an ally into this situation Just in closing and as an example, the mushroom has a tremendous problem-solving Ability and because we can talk to it. We can ask it questions We can actually get a non-human perspective on human problems a Few weeks ago. I made this statement before a group of people somewhere and after the talk was over Somebody came up to me and said well, so why don't you ask the mushroom how to save the world? And I just put it off Thought it was the wrong attitude But then later I wondered about this question how to save the world and and I thought well, maybe I've been too Circumspect with the mushroom. Maybe I should just put it to it So I carried out the experiment and Put to them. How do we save the world? And now I don't offer this as the solution I'm going to tell you the mushrooms answer so that you can see how our backs aren't quite to the wall yet There are still avenues to be explored. I said to the mushroom. How can we save the world? There was a hesitation of one-third of a second Approximately and then the mushroom said No woman should raise more than one natural child And I said what? Said no woman should raise more than one natural child So I took that home with me and I thought about it Here are the consequences of following that piece of advice Following that piece of advice

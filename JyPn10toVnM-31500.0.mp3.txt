Reloaded for the other nostril And then you know in your eyes your sinuses can't believe what's happening to you So you have to sort out this whole sinus Shock, which is going on in parallel within an evolving strange state of mind Which is beginning to take over and and clarify everything and then there are numerous minor variations on these things Might talk just a little bit about the chemistry of these things and the chemistry of hallucinogens generally my attitude toward these this question of plants compounds drugs Should these things be used for spiritual growth? If the answer is no then that finishes you don't have to go any further if the answer is maybe or yes then other questions arise which Compounds out of this whole survey and at what frequency and at what dosage and under what? Circumstances and Over the years I've sort of evolved a three-way test that I will share with you because I think it's maybe them Operationally the most useful thing you'll hear this weekend and that is if you are contemplating some Some compound some plant then the first thing to ask yourself is Does it occur in nature? Does it have some? Tangentiality to what is already existing because obviously what exists that's nature Has undergone some vast winnowing process out of the set of all things which might Exist in that wonderful phrase of Alfred North whiteheads Certain things have undergone the formality of actually occurring You know and and and so certain certain compounds have undergone the formality of actually occurring in the biological matrix and so they should be they should be our pool out of which our Experimental compound should be drawn, but this is thousands of compounds. How can we further narrow it? Well an excellent way of narrowing it further is to ask the question of this compound Does it have a history of human usage? Does it have a history of human usage that is your? FDA approval because if you can point to a tribe of people who have been taking this plant or mushroom or whatever it is for millennia and They don't have miscarriages tumors cataract blindness Down's syndrome Eight fingers on the left hand or whatever it is Then you can be fairly confident that this thing is benign that these people have observed its action on Pregnant women the elderly the those with you know, and and that it has passed that test Then finally the more the narrowest gate through which a compound has to go To to intersect my precious body is it has to have an affinity to ordinary brain chemistry It has to have an affinity to ordinary brain chemistry We don't want to launch something on your brain that it can't recognize at all that it has no Biosynthetic pathways to degrade that it has no receptors for just some crazy thing You know five amino three triethyl Phenthylamine or something. We don't want that. There's not the spirit that we're acting in here So if the compound can get through those three barriers, then it's an excellent candidate for Providing spiritual gain at low physiological Impact. Well now some people may say oh, well, you've taken all the fun out of it All the good things have been tossed aside in this mad rush to purity or something Not at all The very best stuff was retained in this process because In terms of relative strength and Bizarreness of effect and so forth the strangest the most powerful the most transformative of all halocinogens in nature or out is dimethyltryptamine DMT and It's worth talking about DMT for a moment because it will raise certain issues and distinctions That you may not have been aware of First of all DMT is hands-down the most powerful of all Halocinogens, I mean it is so powerful that whatever is in second place is lost over the horizon yet yet It is the most benign of all halocinogens Because it occurs as an endogenous neurotransmitter in the normal human brain we every single one of us at this moment have an end I methyltryptamine being synthesized activated and degraded in our synaptic membrane So this is almost a paradox the most benign of all halocinogens the most fast acting I should also add is also the most Harmless the the easiest to take it sort of remove it sort of puts a certain obligation on the experience Because there is no reason to hold back Except that there is this question Does it drive you mad and then the more serious version of that question? What about the possibility of death by astonishment? This is no joke Death by astonishment is I think probably the major risk we run with this stuff because the impact of the breakthrough is is so total so complete so unexpected and in a way this sort of brings me back around to my theme because I Encountered DMT LSD all of these things in that very period when I was getting set to take flight as a Jungian analyst and What Completely blew my mind about DMT and I mentioned it in again Here's an opportunity for research is how trans here's a heretical construction how trans archetypal the content of the flash Seemed I was appalled Because not only had I a certain amount of interest in Jung and proclivity along those lines But my original major had been art history Art historians what we're trained to do is to be able to look at a motif and say oh, yes I'm familiar from with this from ceramic from second millennia Peru and also Mandaean Embroidery work We know motifs. We're trained to recognize and connect disparate Aesthetic domains. Well when I smoked DMT and came down I said, you know, this is not on the map I can't believe it that this doesn't connect up to anything How can there be domains of the human mind that do not? announce themselves in folklore fairy tales dreams or mandala painting that are so Removed from the Venn of what is human that they are apparently not accessible in structuring our maps of our self and our psyche and that for me was the Contact with what I call and I didn't call it this Rudolph Otto called it This and this term influenced, you know, not all perceived in young was it is the holy other and If there is an archetype of the holy other then this is it but perhaps the whole the other transcends the archetypes this may Explain to some degree young's interest in Gnosticism Especially the Valentinian school of Gnosticism which holds, you know that there is a higher and hidden father all God who is outside the machinery of Cosmic fate and it seemed to me that in those extremely profound DMT flashes I was actually witnessing a domain Outside the machinery of the archetypes, which is for us as moderns That's what the machinery of fate is. It's not zodiacal machinery It's hard wiring in our psychology and our genes that gives us our fate Well, so having said that I've not only made the the Survey, but also brought us to by ending with DMT the Subject matter of this quest and I want to make it clear. I speak about the power of the psychedelic experience Because I think people should be informed of their birthright and I feel very antsy Around the notion that someone might go from birth to the grave without ever having a Psychedelic experience it makes me as antsy as the notion that somebody might go from birth to the grave without having a sexual experience it's a strange kind of Protective Denial or a Kind of expression of fear. This is our birth right? This is part of what it means to be human these altered states of consciousness I think are pretty much scripted in to the existence of women because they Most of them will give birth Which is an organically scripted psychedelic experience from which there is no escape unless of course you go for the drug knockout the spinal and then you miss everything but Biologically physiologically women are set up for this experience men are not it's possible to build such barriers against Overwhelmment that it never happens in your whole life and I believe that if we psychologically analyze the effects of these Psychedelics what they do is they dissolve Boundaries, that's all. I mean if you interview ten thousand people who've had the psychedelic trip Each one has their own Paraphernalia their own heros gamos that unfolded for them But the sum total of it is boundaries dissolved and then whatever's on the other side of your boundary comes flooding in to claim you and To and to reshape and remake your psyche. Well, I see the entire illness of our civilization as and as an ego inflationary Illness we have gone so sick with ego that we are literally murdering the planet rather than confronting the consequences of our psychic imbalance and The psychedelics act to redress this they are almost an inoculation Against the ego and I I see the ego as a phenomenon arising in historical time Or rather actually history is caused by the ego, but the ego is a component of the psyche that arose in the post archaic phase in the post psychedelic phase It's entirely a modern invention, it's less than 15,000 years old and the assumptions of the ego are the source of our Neurosis our disequilibrium, why did the ego arise? it arose because of the Climatologically enforced abandonment of these Psychedelic religions of the archaic period in other words, here is the scenario as I see it Primates even primitive even Non-advanced primates like squirrel monkeys howler monkeys these kinds of primates all have male dominance Hierarchies the whole thing with primates is about male dominance but a lot of things about human beings Marcus as the most unique member of the primate group Obviously we look Different from any other monkeys even the stranger monkeys Look more like the normal monkeys than then we look like them or they like Look like thus us our upright posture. The other thing about us is our suppressed estrus Cycle we cannot tell at a glance whether a woman is In heat or not and yet obviously that had a tremendous shape

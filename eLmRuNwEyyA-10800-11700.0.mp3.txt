chewing beetle nut that that's what that about kava kava kava is piper methisticum this is a plant that occurs throughout Oceania and Micronesia and has a very exotic chemistry bis nor young gonine and nor bale cysteine are the active principles these two compounds are known otherwise only from a mushroom kava is a kind of dreamy intoxicant you feel you don't feel like doing much but you really enjoy just sitting there on the beach and it's soporific kind of it causes a bizarre condition which is called crocodylism and crocodylism is where your skin dries and cracks and migrates into little pyramidal shapes and when Captain Cook landed in the Hawaiian Islands he was of course meeting the high mucky mucks of the Hawaiian royalty he thought everybody had leprosy he didn't know what kind of a hell he'd fallen into until they put it together said no no these are the royal families all of these people are suffering from kava addiction crocodylism it's not pleasant tasting it's not a pleasant high but recently I was in another state and I had an errand to a very chance errand carried me to the house of someone I didn't know and there on the table in this house was this huge bowl this carved Fijian kava bowl and I walked over and and looked at it and it was full of this milky creamy stuff and I stuck my finger in and I tasted it and it was kava and I turned to the lady of the house said what's the story and she said my husband was in the Peace Corps in Fiji he loves this stuff and I so then I met him and talked to him about it he said I'm a chronic alcoholic I can't touch a drink I can't touch a drop but I drink this and I love it and I said well do you know about crocodylism and he he said oh yes and he lifted up his shirt and scratched his chest a huge cloud of dandruff rose so sometimes you never know it's the people I hang out with could you ask the mushroom what we should do about George Bush I have hope for the man he has such a botanically promising name the ones that I'm not reading aloud are the ones which seem to go to areas of my concern that I haven't addressed here today so I don't carry you over into them this is an important question what is your view of introducing psychedelics to children and the initiation of children into altered states this is so controversial so hot that other than reading the question I'm not sure what I could say at the bridge conference at Stanford a few weeks ago there was a woman's panel Kat was on it Carolyn Garcia Cindy Palmer Horowitz Nina Gravois some of the great psychedelic women and this is very important to discuss some of you may have read on John by Robert Bly where he makes a tremendous case that fathers should provide initiatory experiences for their children and you know we're not talking an overnight trout fishing trip here I think this definitely needs to be discussed I'd be more comfortable with women discussing it because I think women are the caregivers and the child rears largely but it's really a problem I mean it's a problem for us that we even do these things in a climate of legal intolerance and then you know to put it on to our children to make criminals of our children you know I mean you can lose your children with a stunt like that this is very touchy and yet I see it as a First Amendment right it's a matter of religious conviction and I don't know my hope is that someday this religious conviction issue is going to collide right into the psychedelic issue because I do not see how we can live under a constitution that guarantees life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and say that psychedelic drugs are illegal I mean if the pursuit of happiness means anything it must cover that now I've had constitutional scholars explain to me that well no you don't understand Hamilton wanted it to say life liberty and the right to own property and Jefferson objected so they decided they put in language that was meaningless so they settled on the pursuit of happiness but I say let's take that meaningless language in the Constitution and turn it into the greatest social revolution that's ever been seen children and psychedelic and here's a technical question that isn't there about mushroom media that we should spare the rest of you all three explanations of the tykes are interesting but our interpretations of experience what if your tykes are contemplations which are becoming as diversely as they see themselves the self-reflection of intelligence contains all forms correct but then why these forms and why so persistently you know to anybody who says something is everything devolves the obligation of explaining then why it appears to be specifically something and I've taken lots of psychedelic compounds and I don't get tykes anywhere else I think this is somehow specific to the beast oh this is an interesting this is more a statement than a question quantum mechanics especially the Schrodinger's cat experiment show that we are simultaneously dead and alive rather like a cuckooly resonance structure of the two DMT creatures are consistent with contemporary science this is true I mean language is what divides but what is divided is not divided it simply is peers divided through the convention of language I'm real uncomfortable with this death and DMT issue because I don't know quite what to do with it it's a little I like profundity but even that seems like deeper water than I wanted to get into how does ibogaine relate to MDMA in opening the heart oh this is a funny thing about compounds most most drugs after their discovery in the process of entering general awareness undergo a phase in which they are the love drug this happens marijuana has been the love drug LSD has been the love drug psilocybin has been the love drug a slightly different kind of love but cocaine has been called the love drug MDMA is called a heart opening drug and ibogaine as I talked about and then I've had tremendous heart openings on other things not related to this and and even DMT sends you down with an acute perception and appreciation of what a wonderful thing it is to be alive chemically MDMA doesn't relate to ibogaine at all I think this opening of the heart thing is something that many drugs make possible and we just need to give ourselves permission to do it the great power of MDMA is in what's called directed psychotherapy where a therapist helps you sort out your problems but we haven't seen nor are we likely to see any comparison studies of how well MDMA stacks up against LSD or psilocybin or mescaline I some therapists have preferred MDMA because they like how it sort of stays on the surface no Titanic hallucinations no visitations by flying saucers just an acute awareness of what a schmuck you may have been well other people want this deep material want the dreamlike mythological stuff to be brought up so that's sort of a matter of faddism I think that any drug any drug that you're unfamiliar with may well open your heart just in poking around opening the heart is an act of attention in a state of unusual psychic dynamics and the unusual psychic dynamics part can be provided by number numerous substances how rich in psychedelics are the Caribbean islands especially Haiti and the Dominican Republic there are psychedelic plants in the Caribbean islands there are the mushrooms certainly and there are these an adenanthra trees the source of the neopo snuffs and there are detours there is also a fairly highly evolved folk medicine in some of those areas if some of you are ethno botanists or aspiring ethno botanist but you have language difficulty think about some of the English-speaking islands of the Caribbean or think about Belize Belize is a fascinating cultural area the three language groups of Belize are English Spanish and Mayan and it's not at all unusual to meet someone who speaks Mayan and English and that's what you're looking for because then you're informant you can actually form a real relationship there so there are many interesting plants in the New World tropics including the the Caribbean islands pardon me frogs I don't know about Caribbean frogs but since you raised this question they're not frogs first of all they're toads we don't want the toads to feel left out this is a phenomenon that's arisen in the past few years some of you may know of it that these large toads buffo alvarez toads you can capture them out in the American Southwest at a certain time of year and take them back to your four-wheel drive vehicle and and put pressure on the glands on the back of their neck and get them to squirt out five MEO DMT fairly pure I mean I must be it looks like must be 70% the real thing squirted onto the windshield of your four-wheel drive vehicle and then with your frost scraper after a few hours you can scrape this stuff up and bag it up and rush back to Berkeley and sell it on the street for $80 a gram toad foam it's interesting toad foam is what it's called it raises some interesting issues because so far as I know it's the only animal based psychedelic to have any availability at all there are known animal psychedelics the most spectacular example is a fish off the coast of Norfolk Island in in the South Atlantic where and this fish contains DMT and there are other fish with DMT in them but this toad foam is the first example of an animal based hallucinogen actually showing up as a product on the underground so that tree frog from Peru this is pardon me is that the Matisse word well this is all Peter Gorman's fieldwork and I respect Peter Gorman he's not a personal friend of mine because I haven't spent that much time with him but he seems to know more about this than anybody else he's the only white person to have any information firsthand about it his account is that these extremely uncontacted people in the Amazon have a tree frog which exudes something on its belly and they take a burning stick

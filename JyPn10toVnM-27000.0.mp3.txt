Target and in the center is DMT and I'm on the record I guess is saying if you can get more loaded than that. I don't want to know about it However now we you should never never say never So DMT at the center of the bullseye then around that next circle out high dose psilocybin eight grams and up eight grams and up then around that high dose LSD mescaline and it gets its fades out and dose is very important in other words You know, there are people running around who took psychedelics once and think then that they should pontificate about it You know 100 gamma of LSD is Nothing like 500 gamma of LSD and 500 gamma of LSD is not putting the system at risk at all and yet it's certainly putting people's Psychology and self-image at risk I mean they assume they'll never live to tell the tale usually in these cautious days anyway But the organism is not at risk You know a lot of people take mushrooms that at very low doses Half gram one gram two gram for them. They think that's getting spectacular for a hundred and forty five pound person the action begins at five dried grams and Goes up from there and quickly becomes unenglishable and completely difficult to convey back As long as we're on this subject, I suppose and in the interest of staying current as Some of you probably know in the last several years an entirely new Psychedelic has appeared on the scene completely confounding both psychedelic enthusiasts Order freaks the law the chemists everybody I'm speaking of salvia divinorum, and it's active principle alpha salvinorin if You are so a soul of such rectitude That you've been putting off doing psychedelics because they're illegal This is the one for you It's not illegal. It's legal. It's as legal as Little green apples are legal As long as everyone well, and I don't know I don't know whether May even just be legal in other words to suppress this would at this point in the drug Dialogue would cost the other side a lot of effort and Possibility and probably the effort would fail Almost everything about salvia divinorum is unusual first of all It's not an alkaloid all other psychedelics True psychedelics are alkaloids with the single exception of mescaline Mescaline is as an amphetamine very close to alkaloids the compound that's active in alpha in salvia divinorum alpha salvinorin is a Diterpene Not an alkaloid the only psychoactive Diterpene ever discovered, so that's one thing unusual about it another thing unusual about it is It's active under one milligram Now that means that approximately 800 Micrograms of this stuff is the effective dose this is similar in the LSD range Except LSD you took orally this you smoke When you talk about smoking 800 Micrograms of material we're talking about a very small grain of salt So the potential for overdose on the pure compound is almost inevitable Well again what I I have not had the guts to smoke the pure compound having watched people melt and twitch fairly dramatically DMT test pilots come back ashen white knuckled I Chew the stuff I Chew 35 grams of it in darkness, and then spit it out when I feel it begin to come on It's absolutely remarkable How powerful it is and you're lying there thinking this can't be legal You know I mean this this actually works. Yes I Don't know if it's been synthesized. It's been extracted I think that It's a very interesting situation for our community This stuff is not illegal If we want it to remain legal We should not provide horrific examples of its abuse Now it seems like in in that effort It's doing its part to aid us people are appalled by this stuff. I mean people who style themselves hardcore After one pass near this just say yeah, it did dissolve reality Yes, it did blow my mind, but they don't come out of it clawing to do it again But I don't say a psychedelic has to be Pleasant to do its work what its what its mission is is to dissolve boundaries and and conditioning Being a psychedelic Well, there's just a certain Clarity of vision that if you get that I think you have to call it psychedelic For instance ketamine ketamine doesn't isn't isn't a psychedelic It's a something it messes with your mind for sure And it certainly dissolves Boundaries and on and on and on but it it occludes in Some way I mean it is after all an anesthetic its purpose is to knock you out If higher consciousness lies in the direction of anesthesia. What is higher consciousness? so and but the the salvia divinorum And it's used shamanically in Mexico and the plant is easily grown and Transported I think it would be a fine notion for people who are interested in all these things To grow and cultivate this stuff and come to terms with it. It's a it's It's It's very interesting to me that's so late in this psychedelic game an entire new Compound in an entire new family could be found and of course now that it's been found They're going into its botanical sources with extremely Subtle Nondestructive analytical methods like high-pressure liquid gas chromatography and this sort of thing And lo and behold, there's an entire family a little solar system of these diterpene Compounds that are psychoactive. Well, what are these? Are these the? drugs of addiction and abuse of the future or are they the source of new Tranquilizers new treatments for mental illness Nobody knows. It's just sitting there So, you know if you're looking for a career in pharmacology or medical research or something like that This is very hot at the moment And if we needed to produce metric tons of this material for any purpose, it could be easily done There's no theory your perspective on the importance of saying Setting Well, I I think set and setting are Extremely important just to review, you know the setting is where you are when you do it a psychedelic and the set is your mindset what you bring to it and These seem to be the the the rule these are Tim Leary's rules are back from the Harvard days and people abuse These these rules terribly and almost always then get into trouble This goes under the heading of don't be an idiot Don't be foolish Let's talk about the setting first of all, I think the worst setting for taking drugs is complex social environments especially public social Environments. So in spite of the grand tradition to the contrary, I think rock concerts The LA free yeah heavy and driving, you know, I've had people ask me about mushrooms or even DMT Well, if I take it will I be able to drive? Well, what kind of half-wit are you? You know just give it a rest for crying out loud No, if you smoke DMT for those ten minutes, just leave your Ferrari parked, please I Think you really have to know yourself and your dose levels I mean I've experimented over the years because I've been at this for who knows how long so there's been plenty of time to Experiment and there were times when I would I would just to see what it would do I would take half a gram of mushrooms a day and Or one mushroom one gram of mushrooms a day. I hated all these states I quickly abandon all these Experiments because all I could do with those kinds of doses was it made me anxious It made me think a lot about the fact that I wasn't really high but it was rougher than coffee and Just was kind of crazy-making and so I I'm in fit I believe in large doses rarely I think that's what's effective and the people want to tiptoe in if you're a tiptoe inner Back to the ashram for you. This is no game for those who wish to tiptoe Because those are dangerous areas those shallow waters most psychedelic people I think Would agree where it's it's not the high dose that blasts your world to smithereens that leaves people Upset and confused that's usually experienced as a kind of liberation what leaves people upset and confused is to get half in and half out and Not be able to come contact the transcendent, but to have all their baggage in there with them fully illuminated and then You know other people complicated. I find other people very Complicating other people it just stands to reason are the most complicated objects in your universe and you know when I'm stoned on Seven or eight grams of psilocybin For me to be able to handle a chunk of orange without getting excited to the point of hysteria is so let alone having somebody maybe want to have sex with you or maybe want to discuss their bad trip with you or Maybe want to move from here down to the beach or maybe one and just say you know I Tend to recommend to do it alone, but I know it's dangerous advice and when I was young I It was a long time I can't really even remember when it was that I settled in on that because at first when we Encountered LSD you would never have done it alone I mean it was always your friends the party the the the band the the something-or-other But I just had too many LSD trips like that where I came down holding my head saying you know I'm I've been fucked with basically because I let other people into my head and You know to me and maybe this is you know I am a double Scorpio and reclusive and all this you got to take it with a grain of salt But I remember times in Berkeley

I think pretty much delivered us as firm a map of the psyche, as dependable a map of the psychic geography as we can expect to have until we make the trip ourselves and you know readjust the landscape with our own notes and observations. For Jung the great path into the unconscious was alchemy and alchemy is an interesting pivotal domain because I think we could in a way say it lies halfway between the concerns of an archaic shamanism and halfway between the concerns of a quasi-scientific psychedelic attempt to explore consciousness Mercier Lillard wrote a brilliant book on alchemy called the forge and the crucible which is the bridge To show you how you go from Jungian psychology into an understanding of alchemy that approximates Iliad the notion for the alchemists that Jung brought forth very strongly was the idea of projection of psychic contents projection of the active imagination on to processes and Objects in the exterior world in the case of the alchemists. It was the swirling chemical processes in their alembics in their alchemical vessels that they projected the The great round of the archetypes on to these chemical processes they saw crystallization sublimation separation as Statements about the contents of the psyche as much as statements about the exterior world Because for them the firm division between mind and matter The firm ontological division between mind and matter that is built into Western thinking now did not exist that comes with Rene Descartes with the invention of what's called the res extensa the Extended world and the res verans the interior world which has no spatial extension So for the alchemist mind and matter worth were two terms whose mutual exclusivity could be blurred under certain circumstances and the terms of one Could migrate toward the other well now we as modern ordinarily only experience this state when we are intoxicated by Hallucinogenic drugs or when we are in a state of severe psychic weakness when there is then Overwhelmment from the unconscious that is not Not with the permission of the ego as happens in the psychedelic Experience. Well, all of these various ways of approaching the psyche Seem fairly abstract and bloodless and removed from daily existence unless the psychedelic experience is Present and then it vivifies These metaphors it makes clear what these various perennial traditions are talking about So what I thought I would try to do today and you're welcome to try and steer it other directions in the question-and-answer period is The the workshop is sacred plants as guides a lot of information has to be imparted if we're going to satisfy my pedagogical urge here Because I would really like to leave you with information that you didn't have before Some of which may have practical efficacy in in your own Life, so in thinking about this very large issue sacred plants as guides I basically break it down into three categories for ease of handling in a context like this and They are a kind of survey What how many of these plants are there? What are the chemicals that drive them and what is their geographical distribution? in other words, just what are the botanical facts of the matter and then Secondly, I think in order to understand what these things mean for spiritual growth and psychic Development you have to place them in the context and the context is chronological and historical Have these things always been around have shamans always been taking them? How do they relate to the synthetic drugs that have been developed in the last couple of centuries? So the history of our relationship to the Pharmacologically induced ecstasy and then finally and probably we'll get to this this afternoon the phenomenology of the experience and the techniques for achieving and controlling it because this is a Practical there is a practicum here. This is not a course in Mongolian Philology or something like that The ultimate idea is to get those who feel called to the task sufficiently informed and psychically empowered that they can push off Into the oceans of mind in the interior with some fair amount of confidence that they'll return to port with all hands Let's Start sort of with a survey. Let me see. I'm going to talk until 1130 So let's start with the survey then and just talk about what the options are and this will be sort of unstructured and conversational with forays into other areas first of all the striking Thing when you want to study Psychoactive drugs and plants and their impact on human culture and that's really what interests me Is how drugs affect culture after I went through Jung and McClure and an Iliad? My next port of call was McLuhan and I absorbed very deeply the notion that media structure Civilizations in ways that the civilizations are never aware of and Jung of course talked about print and Manuscript and electronic culture. He did not talk about drugs but drugs are a form of media because they information travels through the drug to mind that's a medium of communication and various societies wear drugs Like clothing with no awareness of their existence at all somewhat in the way that a fish relates to water So that for instance if you're in Dublin you are swimming in the ambience of an alcohol culture You don't have to be drunk to be in Dublin, although it helps but the the entire society is premised on the possibility See the entire society is premised on the possibility in India the entire society is premised on the possibility of hashish intoxication and social mores building design Everything takes account of this cultures don't see this. We do not think of ourselves as a Meat sugar alcohol culture people do not walk around saying. Oh wow. I'm so high on Meat alcohol and sugar you know I can hardly stand it, but they are and certain Consequences flow from that so as I make my way through this survey you need to bear in mind that a culture Takes its tone its clothing from the drugs that it admits And you can know a great deal about a culture from the drugs that it excludes the drugs that it excoriates and fears because various drugs Accentuate and suppress different parts of the psyche so these are statements about anxiety about various parts of psyche The striking thing when you set out to do a cultural survey like this is you discover that our culture the culture of Europe for most of us some of us are black some of us are Asian But the largely the roots of American culture lie in Europe. This is the most Pharmacologically impoverished Cultural area on the entire planet it has the longest history of Disconnection from any kind of ecstatic intoxication and the cultural forms of Europe linear abstract Narcissistic and promoting of male dominance are to my mind exactly what you would expect in a culture Long deprived of the boundary dissolving numinous encounter with the vegetable mind so a lot of the cultural problems We're dealing with are based on the fact that we as Europeans have no place for drugs we don't really know quite what to do with that as as you move south from Europe into the continent of Human origins Africa you discovered that while Africa supports a tropical Ecosystem which because that means increased Speciation of plants you would think would indicate an increased number of hallucinogens Africa is surprisingly poor in Hallucinogens, this is not well understood as we go through this survey. I will make reference to numerous Unsolved mysteries in the field and I always try to do this because I'm hoping that there are graduate students Listening who are looking for research topics and there are numerous research areas where? Important work can be done. One of them is this question of the poverty of hallucinogens in Africa. Why? Does it have something to do with the extreme length of time that Africa has been subject to human impact probably Because Africa is species poor generally for a tropical continent however in the interest of thoroughness, there is one hallucinogenic drug complex that should be mentioned because it raises issues that are important for the broader context and that is Ibogaine or tabernanthus iboga the so-called Bawiti cults of Zaire and Gabon now this is the Psychedelic about which we in the West probably know the least it has spawned no waves of social hysteria It has not been the subject of pogroms or media freak-out It's and it's a powerful Hallucinogen and it's not only a powerful hallucinogen, but it has a component of sexual excitation which is ancillary and usual If you actually have ever looked into the fictive aphrodisiacs That is very There are things cause genital chaining and prolonged erection and so but a true Aphrodisiac a chemical which would impel you to want to have sex There's nothing quite like that except this tabernanthus iboga is very interesting we tend to think of an aphrodisiac because we tend to break our heart away from our genitals as a kind of a as a kind of a A Cold Thing I think but when you talk to these people who are taking ibogaine, they don't talk about aphrodisiac They say this causes open heartedness one heartedness They call it and one heartedness is what they are striving for in the bowie T cult and they achieve it and They achieve it And it allows them to resist cultural incursions by Christian missionaries But we T is the main cultural force that is holding back conversion to Christianity by these people Fang culture the people who are using this ibogaine. It's an interesting culture It there's a great deal of anxiety in Fang culture about divorce Because and relationships between men and women Divorce is very easily obtained among the Fang but it's always followed by extremely lengthy and protracted negotiations with the family of the divorced partner about return of dowry and The huge amount of neurosis and agony and murder and violence goes on over these dowry return negotiations the ibogaine Stands right in the middle of this as a source of one heartedness Making divorce less likely so it's very important as a force for Social cohesion and I mentioned this because when we reach, Ayahuasca, we will see

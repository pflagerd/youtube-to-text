yes we're great people but so are you and this is your affinity group someone in this room has what you need someone in this room appreciates what you've got so look at each other and pay attention we are each like a virus empowered now to go out in society and spread this new meme this new permission this new community of awareness of the archaic option and so I think you are to be congratulated you are what makes this all go if it weren't for you I would be behind bars I don't know whether it would be a mental hospital or a state prison but they'd figure that out later thanks to you we have a movement and this movement offers hope and I think we need to speak clearly about this hope to people who are not aware of it an idea has no power unless it is communicated and we are to some degree in the closet we are prudent we don't say we're gutless we say we're prudent we're prudent say this is no political climate in which to be X Y and Z but actually there's no better political climate than the present in which to raise these issues because the rainforests are being destroyed the native cultures are being destroyed our authenticity as free-thinking people is being destroyed all around the issue of the suppression of altered states and freedom to conduct the spiritual quest any way we want and if we don't raise our voices in protest against this then without doubt it will be slowly drained away and we will be left in even more of a psychic desert than we already inhabit so this is the last opportunity I think that in a hundred years the earth will be empty and whether that will be because we are extinct or because we found home is entirely up to us but our story the story of the errant monkey is coming to an end the final seconds of that story are ticking out is it to be followed by no more story or a new chapter a new story well this has to do with how much integrity how much self-generated love and how much intelligence we can bring to bear to the human dilemma and these plants these sacraments are central to a full exploration and understanding of what it means to be a human being it's just that simple

Of course. Here is the formatted and proofread version of your text. I have corrected minor grammatical errors, improved sentence flow for clarity and impact, and adjusted the punctuation for a more polished, speech-like delivery.

I think of this as the "mushrooms and evolution" talk. We will rove and scan over that subject, but it also arborizes into many other areas of concern. It is not simply a re-visioning of anthropology, primatology, or evolution. It is all those things, but more importantly, it is a re-visioning of those concerns that then carries a political and social implication for the moment and for how we all lead our lives.

It is basically a variation on the hero's journey, and I am very indebted to a brilliant woman anthropologist whom I have never met, but whose book had a great influence on me: Misia Landau. She recently wrote a book called *Narratives of Evolution*, and she pointed out something that I think has needed to be pointed out for a long time: that science is simply campfire stories in another guise.

You will see what I mean as I get into this, because I want to tell you a campfire story. It's about a poor but humble primate who came from the fringes of the action—a minor member of the flora and fauna of this planet—who embarked on a long and arduous journey through time. This primate had many adventures along the way, found many allies, and overcame great challenges to attain a gift difficult to come upon: the grail, if you will, or the self. All fans of Joseph Campbell are familiar with this metaphor of the hero's journey.

What's interesting is that we have actually made that hero's journey. We are, all of us tonight, sons and daughters of the ancestral heroes who overcame drought, glaciation, disease, famine, earthquake, migration—you name it. They didn't drop the ball, and thanks to them, we're here tonight.

Normally, the beginnings of this great journey are completely cloaked in mystery. It's taught in orthodox anthropology courses that no one knows the factors which impelled human beings to leave the primate existence in the canopies of the great forests of Africa and to adopt new styles of life in the grasslands: new diets, trading vegetarianism for omnivorism, trading a life of fruitarian luxury for a life of hunting, struggle, migration, and natural selection in an extremely harsh environment.

I believe the reason this seems so mysterious to mainstream primatologists and anthropologists is because they have been unwilling to look carefully at the role that plants played in this adventure—particularly the role that psychoactive plants may have played, and then, most appropriately for this gathering tonight, the role that certain species of psychoactive mushrooms *must* have played in this evolutionary adventure.

And so tonight, I would like to go through it with you in fairly close detail. I haven't had that many original ideas in my life; most of what I do is book reviews and regurgitation of other people's ideas. But this one they handed over to me, and I've been told by evolutionary anthropologists that I'm welcome to it. So if I don't make the case, who will? And if not now, when? And if not here, where?

The great mystery of natural life on this planet is ourselves. We stand out in the natural order of things as something completely unique, unexpected, and unpredictable. You could not calculate forward from the pinnacle of the age of mammals some 30,000 years ago to a world such as we have today: a world of enormous cities globally dispersed, linked instantly by electronic media; a world of art, warfare, neurosis, vision, religious yearning, hope, and despair. All of these things are the unique contribution made to reality—to existence, if you will—by the qualities in us which we call humanness, which set us aside from the rest of organic existence.

I know that dolphins discuss arcane matters among themselves, and bees dance the directions to the flowers, and animal communication occurs among pack-hunting dogs of various sorts. But clearly, we are something of another order. Accounting for this other order of being that is so present in us has been the major concern of both what we call religion and what we call science—not in the sense of physics and chemistry, but of biology, anthropology, and psychology. How do we account for the uniqueness of our species, and then the uniqueness that is present as a moment-to-moment fact in each one of us?

You have to go back to the origin scenario. Look at the other theories in place, and then look at the possibilities for theory-making that are offered if we're willing to include the presence of a psychedelic substance in the experience and diet of early human beings.

For several million years, the great apes had been evolving into tighter and tighter niches in the climax tropical rainforests of both the New and Old World. At a certain point—difficult to place because it's locked into the gradually shifting dynamics of climate on this planet—these forests began to retreat. They began to diminish because of an absence of rainfall over very long periods of time. We know that many primate lines went extinct at that point. But one primate line, the anthropoid apes, was able to evolve a new lifestyle in the grasslands that were evolving as the forests retreated.

Now, some anthropologists have argued, to my mind very convincingly, that there is no such thing as a natural grassland; that grasslands are caused by fire—human burning. The argument is easy to understand: all the species of plants you find in the grasslands, you also find in the understory of the forests on their borders, but you find only a small number of the forest species represented in the cleared areas. For an evolutionary botanist, this clearly means that the grasslands are extraordinarily recent, wherever they occur all over the earth—and this includes the high-altitude grasslands called savannas.

I think that the missing link in evolution is probably food. Somebody once accused me of trying to recover the lost history of mankind, and I said, "No, simply the lost menu of mankind." Well, what was that menu, and how did it impact us?

First, before we discuss psilocybin mushrooms specifically, I'd like you to think about the ways in which we differ from other primates. We maximize what is called **neoteny**. Neoteny is the phenomenon in which juvenile characteristics are retained into adulthood. This is a particularly effective strategy in any situation where you're up against an evolutionary bump in the road or barrier of some sort. Many species show a tendency toward neoteny, but it's very strongly expressed in human beings.

For example, our hairlessness: we are like infants. All primates are born pretty much hairless, but we retain this hairlessness throughout life. The ratio of our skull size to body size is an infantile ratio. Compared to other primates, we look like the juvenile form, and we never lose that. The extreme length of human childhood and adolescence is a kind of strategy so that a lot of developmental processes can occur outside the womb. You probably know that a deer or a calf is able to stand within hours of being born; a human infant struggles to acquire this skill in the first 18 months of life.

What promoted this neoteny? What promoted our upright gait? What promoted our acquisition of language? This is critical, and I'll talk more about it later. Language is the great divide between us and other species. Where it exists at all as a tendency in other species, it is very rudimentary and unschooled. For us, it has become almost the *raison d'être* of our being.

Physical evolution ceased in the human species when we began to elaborate languages and the technologies that follow from them. We designed a way around the slower-than-glaciers modification of species that occurs through random mutations acted upon by natural selective forces. Until the invention of epigenetic—meaning non-genetic—forms of coding (language, dance, theater, myth-telling, and so forth), we were as much an animal as any other on this planet.

So, what happened was this: the forests retreated. These environments, where food had been very abundant, became nutritionally stressed. The diet had to be expanded. The choice was simple: expand your diet or die.

Now, it's interesting. Most animals have a very narrow range of foods they will accept. This reaches its greatest expression in insects. Some of you may have learned as children that if you find a caterpillar walking on the ground and put it on the nearest plant—if by chance you chose the wrong plant—it will die rather than eat it. Insects are very, very food-specific. Most animals are.

Why is this? You would think it would be a better strategy to be able to eat a lot of things. The answer is that foods are chemically extraordinarily complex, and chemical complexity is another way of saying "potentially toxic or mutagenic." Mutation is the undoing of any species or any adaptation. So there is an effort by organisms to avoid this—not a conscious effort, but one enforced by natural selection.

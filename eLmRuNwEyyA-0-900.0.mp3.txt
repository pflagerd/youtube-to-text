I started out my academic career as an art historian with a major in Asian languages and that took me to Asia and sort of disillusioned me with the traditional spiritual approaches in the Asian style and I reconnected then with my childhood love of nature and pretty much abandoned the humanities and went into the sciences but by then it was too late to become a real scientist and I was too tainted by my time again among the poets and the artists so I had to become a very soft hard scientist so I got a degree in conservation of natural resources about as soft a science as you'll ever hope to touch and I did a lot of traveling around looking for a viable vibrant numinous approach to spiritual reality and the only place I found it was in the Amazon basin where as you know there are extremely archaic groups of people people who never submitted themselves to the the historical process the way the peoples of the Middle East and Europe did and there their flourishes through the use of chemically complex plants techniques and traditions for accessing a world invisible to the rest of us a world of forces and information that is transhuman supernatural if the word means anything but this this supernatural dimension is anchored in the plants that live in our world and my brother was a botanist and I had botanical training as we studied the psychoactive plants of the world especially the New World tropics where they seem to be concentrated we were simultaneously exalted by the realization that we had found a doorway a real doorway into hyperspace and at the same time tremendously upset and and alarmed by the fact that this doorway is in the process of being dismantled by the forces of human ignorance that are not even aware of its existence so this was the impulse behind the decision on the part of my partner Kat and I that these plants must be saved they must be preserved in germplasm repositories or botanical gardens or something like that toward a day when they can be studied and the power the dimensions within them can be given their real weight so to this end we founded a botanical garden in Hawaii that is specifically dedicated to preserving plants with a history of shamanic importance and I mentioned this because this is the real world political work that we do and everything else I will say today will be barely anchored in any world familiar to most of us but there is a political anchoring there is a place where it all comes tangential to the World Bank and the IMF and the host governments and so forth and so on it is tremendously important to preserve this shamanic option if for no other reason than we do not know what it is we do not know what it is well so at the break if you come up there newsletter of our botanical garden is the large stack of beige paper and there are 300 copies of that so I hope there's enough for for everyone and we do exist on donations so any if any of your philanthropists we can certainly tell you how to spend your money we have many plans for your money okay I wasn't kidding about what an honor I think it is to address the young society at one point in my life my greatest desire was to become a union analyst and I had the good fortune of coming upon Jung very young I was about 15 when a very precocious friend of mine brought psychology and alchemy in the Carrie F Baines translation I think it had just been brought out and we were stunned and we read it from cover to cover and then went on to Mysterium Conjunctiones ion the studies in the phenomenology of the self I said to someone yesterday we read all the books of Jung that the Jungians never read they seem to stop up there toward the front of the line with the archetypes of the collective unconscious and the personality type but to my mind it was the late stuff that was fascinating and I am slightly puzzled and we were talking about it last night at the distance between the Jungian community and the psychedelic community because they seem to me the unschooled observer to be definitely sharing the same concerns and strangely enough they share much of the same history and geography Basel was of course Jung's hometown it was Albert Hoffman's hometown did one half of town know what the other half was doing I'm not sure that the relationship of Jung to the unconscious to the collective unconscious as its discoverer has been always somewhat puzzling to me because of course if you know the history of 20th century art you know that Dada which was the great prefigurative movement for surrealism rose in Zurich so you know we've got LSD the schools of modern art that laid great stress on the irrational and the great schools of psychology that extended the boundaries of the unconscious all raffling around in these little Swiss towns and it's interesting to imagine conversations or meetings that might have taken place when people slightly left their ordinary habits and wandered into bars they didn't know and drank with people they'd never met before because Jung provided maps of the unconscious and at 16 when we were beginning to experiment with this and and let me stress this was before the great social waves of LSD taking of the 1960 just preceding that from about 1963 to 65 we were frantic for maps of the unconscious and Freud was useless I mean the notion that the contents of the psychedelic experience could be reduced to what Freud called day residues and repressed sexual desire and stuff like didn't wash within 10 minutes you could tell that was not a serviceable metaphor Jung on the other hand offered a vast pantheon of gods and archetypes and psychic complexes forgotten or abandoned I mean I thought of Jung basically as a know what I call a noetic archaeologist someone who goes with toothbrush and nut pick to dig away the detritus from the bones of vanished idea systems and if any of you have ever read the complete the works of Jung in the in the Bollingen set you know that the richness of it is all in the footnotes I mean here was a man who raised the footnote to a high art and who was aware of a literature that nobody else to my mind seemed to know about that Jung's references reach a thousand years deep into the past with great density of reference I mean this is where I learned about microbius and dosethius and Dionysus the pseudo areopagus and all those folks that you just never hear about it was my introduction to the under to the underbelly of Western civilization was through Jung well to my mind and now I'll theme this in to today's theme I think Maria mentioned that Jung did not have a lot to say about shamanism he came to it late in his life and he had already worked through the massive the exegesis of the symbol systems of the European mind and so he was sort of content to indicate shamanism as an area of where more work was to be done and then the great follow-on scholar was mercy Leod who then actually studied shamanism showed what its archetypal underpinnings were in all times and places and the combination of Jung and Iliad I think pretty much delivered us as firm a map of the psyche as dependable a map of the psychic geography as we can expect to have until we make the trip ourselves and you know readjust the landscape with our own notes and observations for for Jung the great path into the unconscious was alchemy and alchemy is an interesting pivotal domain because I think we could in a way say it lies halfway between the concerns of an archaic shamanism and halfway between the concerns of a quasi-scientific psychedelic attempt to explore consciousness mercy Leod wrote a brilliant book on alchemy called the forge and the crucible which is the bridge to show you how you go from Jungian psychology into an understanding of alchemy that approximates Iliad the notion for the alchemists that Jung brought forth very strongly was the idea of projection of psychic contents projection of the active imagination on to processes and objects in the exterior world in the case of the alchemists it was the swirling chemical processes in their alembics in their alchemical vessels that they projected the the great round of the archetypes on to these chemical processes they saw crystallization sublimation separation as statements about the contents of the psyche as much as statements about the exterior world because for them the firm division between mind and matter the firm ontological division between mind and matter that is built into Western thinking now did not exist that comes with Rene Descartes with the invention of what's called the res extensa the extended world and the res verans the interior world which has no spatial extension so for the alchemist mind and matter worth were two terms whose mutual exclusivity could be blurred under certain circumstances and the terms of one could migrate toward the other well now we as moderns ordinarily only experience this state when we are intoxicated by hallucinogenic drugs or when we are in a state of severe psychic weakness when there is then overwhelming from the unconscious that is not not with the permission of the ego as happens in the psychedelic experience well all of these various ways of approaching the psyche seem fairly abstract and bloodless and removed from daily existence unless the psychedelic experience is present and then it vivifies these metaphors

stock markets continue to reach new all-time highs in the US Goldman Sachs recently updated their S&P 500 Outlook to 6,300 points uh by year end q1 2025 now Middle East tensions remain top of mind for investors could things escalate between Israel and Iran and if so how would the markets uh react to that information longterm though one of the fundamental drivers of equity's performance uh we're here to discuss this team with Darius Dale he is a founder of 42 macro he's going to give us the medium-term and long-term outlook for the markets and how investors should be positioned right now Darius it's the first time on the show pleasure to host you today welcome it's a pleasure to be here man thanks for having me uh just want to say congrats man I've been uh been watching your growth from afar it's been awesome to watch man so congrats on everything you're building oh well thank you and congrats on um on the company that you told me offline you started this company not too long ago and it's you know it's I've been seeing your research tremendous research let's start with recent news first and I know that your research is based on more longer term fundamentals but we can't ignore I guess some short-term news items that may or may not and I'll let you answer this may or may not increase volatility what's top of mind for you right now in terms of risk factors that could derail the uh 6,000 uh S&P Target that a lot of people have given me on my show yeah look I mean I think it starts uh so phenomenal question I I think anytime Risk Factors for Markets you think about you know trying to understand what the full balance of distribution risks are when you're approaching asset markets I think it's important to understand what has caused the current positioning to build uh in our view the current positioning is associated with a function of three themes one our Brazilian US economy theme which we authored uh back in September of 2022 uh we've seen a general and persistent upside surprise in US growth which we've been calling for for the past couple of years and we expect that to continue and that in our opinion has contributed to some of the uh smilly crowded positioning that we've seen on the long side of risk assets uh the number two theme that we're highlighting is the uh here comes the liquidity theme we have the view that the both us and Global liquidity are set up to accelerate uh marketly over the medium term and that's a function partially a function of the number three theme which we've maintained since November of last year which is our J1 to soft Landing theme this is a Federal Reserve that has an asymmetrically doish reaction function and anytime you hear the phase asymmetrically doish reaction function uh it pays generally pays to be bullish as an investor well let's just uh highlight some of your high U.S. Economic Resilience conviction calls so this came in from a recent research summary uh that your team sent me high conviction again like you just mentioned uh the liquidity issue uh a weak USD should accelerate Global dollar Recycling and provide Chinese authorities uh scope to accelerate support of the economy does this narrative or this thesis depend on who is president by January uh Darius because we do know that Donald Trump is very much bullish in the dollar he wants a strong dollar he's adverse to the dollar losing its uh Reserve status uh pres uh vice president Harris has not made similar comments so I'm curious to see how her monetary policy or even fiscal policies would translate to the dollar uh but what is your take on whether or not the election may impact the dollar yeah the election May certainly impact the dollar if you think about the the two choices that we have as candidates we have camela Harris and Donald Trump uh with respect to you know I think the markets are assuming that there's going to be a significant change in tariff policy and how the US is you know sort of responding to Chinese trade policy and the reality is there's not much of a difference with the big difference that we see is that we're probably going to see an incremental uh uh sort of um application of tariffs towards China but it's very unlikely just based on the folks that Trump has surrounded himself with respect to his economics team if he were to win the election it's very unlikely that we see Liquidity & Fedâ€™s Dovish Stance anything in line with what he's been sort of talking about on the campaign Trail it's a lot it's a very typical you see in elections which is politicians promise a lot and deliver a little and that's sort of our expectation but it it could be something that could cause our conviction in that theme to to Wayne in the coming months okay so let's highlight some of the negatives from both campaign at least the worries from investors on the Trump side tariffs so people are concerned about tariffs Trump has promised to slap on 100% tariffs on some Chinese EVS for example uh or actually no not 100% he recently said 200% he raised that to 200% he promised to uh increase tariffs to 100% on those countries that want to ditch the dollar uh trading with the dollar uh let's comment on that first before we move on to the haris side Donald Trump's tariff policies are they bad for the markets in the past presidency we saw that markets did not like new tariffs on China would things be any different now uh see we have a different take on that I mean we don't think this stuff matters all that much to markets at all I mean if you think about what really genuinely matters to asset markets over medium to long-term time Horizons it's usually uh one of the four final these four things Trump vs. Harris: Impact on the Dollar it's growth it's inflation it's policy and it's liquidity every now and again the profit cycle will kind of rear re it's beautiful or ugly head depending on where you are in the business cycle to have you know significant influence over asset markets but in our view the things that you need to pay most uh most attention to as investors are growth inflation policy and liquidity and with respect to growth inflation policy and liquidity three of those four Cycles as we talked about at the beginning of the show are moving in a direction that is supportive of asset markets the inflation cycle was unlikely to continue moving in Direction that's supportive if only because not if only but but shers would obviously be a secondary uh uh sort of um headwind with respect to that cycle but if you go back to you know 20 2019 and I'm pulling this off the top of my head so don't don't quote me on this but I want to say markets ried about the S&P 500 rallied about 35% in 2019 at the height of the previous sign on us trade War uh that was obviously engineered by executive policy in the Trump Administration so we're not of the view that that's going to be the only thing that matters to asset markets and our opion those those bigger Cycles are what's really driving the boat here and we have a moderately sangu view on most of them before we continue with the interview I want to tell you about another way you can invest your Bitcoins and store them safely instead of using a traditional wallet or an exchange consider an IRA today sponsor itrust capital is one such Ira that offers 35 crypto assets and the lowest trading fees in the crypto Ira space at 1% only and being an IRA it also offers unique tax benefits if You' like to get started and learn more click it trust. capital David in the link

Real Story presidency the last time take a look at the CPI chart let's just back check this if you will um have tariffs been inflationary the CPI overall and you know we can segregate this by specific items but overall during Trump's presidency the CPI didn't Spike to abnormal levels until we had the pandemic and then you know the FED induced in introduced un unlimited QE but can you make the argument now I let me just make the argument that tariffs have not been inflationary overall in the last Administration just looking at the data Am I Wrong Darius no no you're correct tariffs are a regressive tax on consumer spending so it's very likely to be durably reinflation you could have a one-off change in the price level that creates a one-off chock in inflation and I do believe we saw that in 2018 uh relative to the trend of inflation that we observe in the post post crisis era post GFC era we did have a significant increase in inflation to right around 3% on a core basis in 2018 that was a big change from what we had experienced for the prior you know five to seven years so that that was a meaningful uh shift however it wasn't necessarily inflationary in the way that you know UI or consumers Across America are currently sort of um you know characterizing that today so again we we don't believe that tariff policy in and of itself is inflationary well we see the biggest upside risk to inflation siming out of the either the Trump or Populism & Inflation Risks comma Harris administrations because we have a relatively you know sort of similar view on the outlook for fiscal policy in either Administration what we see the inflation uh the the next round of inflation to come from is populism and we continue to seed populism uh Brew up on both sides of the owl mostly as a function of the broken down social contract that we have here in America um you know I'll show a chart uh from our most recent macro Scouting Report every month we publish this a report for our clients here 42 macro uh where we try to help them you know kind of hone in on all the you know kind of big growth inflation policy and and liquidity uh drivers of asset markets and so provide them with a very sanguin clear view of how those things are likely to um to unfold and when you look at this chart here where we show employee compensation divided by uh nominal gross domestic income that's declined about 56% we see corporate profits as a share of gross domestic income that is accelerated to 133% if you go back and you look at the the long-term means of these time series The respective means of these time series they were 63% and 9% respectively so we've had essentially a 400 basis point shift uh away from employee compensation into the the the Cor corporate profits now that doesn't sound like a lot but it's a significant deal as it relates to what drove that uh shift we've seen a hollowing out of the US manufacturing sector over the past 20 to 30 20 to 25 years and as a function of that we've seen a greater and greater share of corporate profits go to or greater and greater share of national income go to corporate profits and part of this in our opinion was globalization obviously we had the NAFTA agreement in the late 90s we had china joined the WTO in 2001 and as a function of those policies and other policies um you know The Fourth Turning Explained not the least of which is QE incessant QE um you know sort of siphoning you know creating a a stimulus for the incomes of the folks in the upper income of the distribution we've had a a series of policies in this economy that have really kind of put the middle to lower quote unquote class on its back you know middle to low income household consumers on their back and as a function of that they're pissed off you know for lack of a better word David they're upset they're frustrated and they're looking for Solutions that's what this is why Donald Trump is a politician this is why we've gotten a sequence of populous monetary and fiscal policy since 2008 and we are like continue to sequence of that populous fiscal policy going forward sorry what is a populous monetary policy po populist monetary policies is socialist monetary policy that so policy that won't allow B big Banks to fail the policy that won't allow you know hedge fund managers you know my clients you know to to to actually have bad years that that's the kind of policy that we we see it's really just all a function of what we see as as kind of the main driver of this which is you know we have this socialist economy that's sort of mas eraing as capitalism but the reality is when you have socialism Democrats they practice socialism for the poor if you look at government social benefits divided by household income that's been up and to the right for the mo for the last couple of generations if you look at the effective corporate tax rate in this country uh has been down and to the right over the past couple of generation so both parties are combining to to support the incomes of their quote unquote cons consu but the reality is is Donald Trump with you know based on some of the work that my former colleague and and Mentor whom you recently had in your show uh David de how based on some of the work that he's um um been exposed to uh uh Vis Steve Bannon he understands this chart here SL 999 which shows the breakdown in the the social contract here in America and as a function of that he's caused not only just the Republican party but he's also pulled the Democrat Party uh even more left and even more populist uh by the way on taxes Okay so so CA Harris wants to raise the corporate tax sorry the capital gains tax not corporate tax she wants to raise corporate taxes as well but capital gains tax to 28% uh that would effectively bring uh a combined total capital gains tax for the top earners to 33% which would be the highest since 1978 would that cause a market sell off uh it probably would yeah but it's unlikely to occur right I mean you have to essentially have a you know super majority in the senate in order to get that done um so it's very likely that we're no matter who wins the White House we're probably going to have some form of a divided government um the highest probability outcome you know we don't Fiscal Support & Market Impact the top of the ticket is a tossup but we know that the Senate is more than likely to flip uh to Republican leadership and we know that the house is have reasonably high probability of of of of of flipping smilly into Democrat leadership so right there alone tells you you're probably not going to get some of the more uh left more aggressive policies from either candidate and so what's more than likely to occur which is why we continue to believe that populism is the only outcome from this from the starting point is more than likely to occurs both parties are going to have to come together to figure out the the the deals what they want out of the negotiation of the expiring uh uh core tenants of the task cuts and jobs act recall that at the end of next year we're going to see significant changes with with with with individual tax policy going back essentially reverting back to where they were in 2017 prior to the Trump tax cuts and so we know that NE no matter who's in office neither party wants that outcome to occur you don't want to implement a significant tax hip on a on on a consumer particularly an economy where we're already observing evidence of you know slack being created in the labor market you know inverted Yi curve etc etc with the fed you know you know kind of responding to all those things you don't want to hike a bunch of taxes because you're essentially going to cause a recession so what's more than likely to happen David is we get Republicans get what they want on their wish list they'll probably get 80% of their wish list and Democrats will get 80% of their wish list no matter who takes the top of the ticket and in our opinion we want investors to be focused on that as the underlying message from us fiscal policy is that the entire curve the entire curve is Shifting left or shifting populace both parties included by the way her the increase on the capital gains tax that I just wrote uh read to you applies to only those people making more than a million dollars annually so you know the top 1% of the population the argument here from the conservatives is that well those people are the people driving growth in the economy and consumption on the most part what is your philosophy here does wealth Trickle down in other words if you if you derail the wealth effect for the wealthiest will that derail the entire economy yeah uh it more than likely would uh I mean you know I'm not a big fan of the uh k-shaped US economy as someone who grew up on the very bottom of part of the K uh you know spent half of my life on the the very bottom of the bottom of the K and now I guess I guess I'm on part of the top card of the K now uh you know Lord willing but uh in our opinion yes so the answer to your question David is yes uh so if you look at the uh share of consumer spending by income cohort here in America what we see is that the upper third of households by income account for 51% of consumer spending which compares to only 15% for the lower third so you know one of the things that we've been you know sort of pounding the table on for the past couple of the years that has become consensus but it was a consensus when we when we authored the theme back in September of 2022 was our resilient US economy theme and part of the the one of the core tenants of that theme was what you and I are discussing right now which is the environment for rich people in this country is actually quite favorable we you know we have policy that is you know getting incrementally favorable and and as long as that's the case we're pro and as long as you know asset markets you know back then we were kind of at the lows of markets but if they started to recover which we anticipated that they would if they started to recover then you're going to see a you know continued expansion of the US business cycle and that's exactly what we observed and that's exactly what we're likely to see assuming that no policies are going to be sign no significant policies are going to be enacted that kind of disrupts that apple cart and again it's very unlikely we see the apple cart materially disrupted in the context of Medium-Term Bullish Outlook the composition of uh the white the composition of the White House and Congress that we're going to observe you know some point in Q4 I mean again we don't have the view that the election is going to be decided on November 7th but we do have a view that we're probably going to wind up with divided government a divided government means both parties get what they want as opposed to neither party gets what they want Game Theory okay um that's very interesting so what you're saying is uh either way can we see the wealth Gap um close or not widen as much if the country is leaning more socialist from both parties well that's one of the key core tenants of the fourth turning right I mean you have you think about one of the big dynamics that occurs in a fourth turning is you typically have a significant decline uh in in uh in income inequality and that's something that we've observed so uh we did a big deep dive statistical study you know picking backing on my uh my mil how's work on the fourth turning his work is more focused on the uh geopolitical drivers and and outcomes in in the economy we're focused more on what's going to happen with the economy what's going to happen with uh policy and how those things are going to impact asset markets because again what we're trying to do here at 42 macro is help our clients make money in financial markets and so one of the things that we typically observe in A4 turning in the context of this big deep dive empirical study that we did where we analyzed you know time series going all the way back to 1800s so we can get a sense of how do these time series statistically evolved in this forth turning process and one of the things we found you know with data as far back as we can get it is that if you go back and you look at income inequality as a function of the top 10 share of national income what you typically observe in this this previous four turning was that it declined sharply uh throughout the duration of the four turning and so as a you know we're kind of you know we're starting from a very high level again and it's our expectation that income inequality declines sharply throughout the duration of this for turning so we're going to see policy in our opinion that is incrementally populous that essentially it's you know Robin Hood policy if you will we're going to take from the rich and give to the poor now it may not not happen next next year in the context of a divided government it may be in response to a bigger crisis that investors are s that that that that you know both households and investors need to navigate But ultimately I think as an as an in as someone as an investor or just even someone as a voter you need to be aware that things are probably going to get better after they get worse in the context of this this broad four turn view I interviewed ne how on the fourth Geopolitical Conflicts & Market Response turning and one of the tenants of the fourth TR but by the way for the viewers who don't know are familiar with the concept every 80 years there is some sort of generational crisis that needs to happen and you probably know more about this than I do so you can explain more detail in this fourth turning a lot of things could happen rise of populism like you talked about um rise of conflicts internally and perhaps even externally so we're talking about um civil conflict Civil War perhaps in the extreme case and obviously Global Wars as well Rising uh we're talking about uh perhaps um a different change an attitude from one generation to another but generally speaking from what I gather from Neil how we're looking at perhaps more volatility is more fear ratchets up but yet you told me offline and this is your core thesis for investing is that you're still medium-term bullish so how do you reconcile the differences between the coming of the fourth turning and your bullish Outlook yeah 100% it's it's it's how the fourth turn it's how policy makers have historically responded to these geopolitical and economic soci economic developments historically they have responded uh with two things one a lot of fiscal support of the economy which obviously creates a higher nominal GDP environment uh which is generally supportive for for asset markets or for risk asset markets l so for for for defensive assets like treasury bonds uh and then what we typically see from the Federal Reserve uh is monetary debasement and financial repression and so it's our belief that as a function of those three things excessive fiscal policy support of the economy monetary debasement to capitalize that fiscal support and uh and and currency um devaluation uh to to capitalize that fiscal support as well if you put those three things together you should be just like we've been for a long time here 42 macro structurally bullish on risk assets like stocks credit crypto Commodities and structurally bearish on defensive assets like treasury bonds and US dollar doesn't necessarily mean the treasury bonds or and or the US dollar going to decline in price the dollar would likely decline in price as a function of those policies doesn't necess mean the treasury bonds are going to decline in price because we're getting Financial pressure so uh you know I'll show you a couple charts uh from our for turning analysis that sort of support that uh takeaway uh so one of the things that we observed uh in this study that money supply growth uh tends to accelerate sharply uh during fourth turning so that's something that we're anticipating as investors if we have a significant uptake in money supply growth you're talking about a significant uptick in liquidity and historically a significant upticks in liquidity have done you know that have you know perpetuated you know Raging Bull markets and risk assets the other thing I would highlight is with respect to uh the financial repression that we're likely to uh see the 12 month real T Bill yield has tended to decline substantially in fourth turnings which means the FED has a uh negative policy rate on an inflation adjusted basis you've also seen the same similar Dynamics with the 10year real treasury yield so there is an Evidence of financial repression occurring in this fourth turning and we have a belief that we're probably going to see even more financial repression in this particular fourth turning than we have historically if you look at this chart here where we show uh the uh the private sector uh sorry we we show we break down the the the market treasury Securities Market into its various large investor cohorts so you have the Federal Reserve which is Shar is declining it's plus 16% or 16% of the total now uh you have commercial Banks us commercial Banks their share has been declining since 2021 as well they're now 15% of the total and then if you have foreign central banks which is the black line that Peak back in 2008 uh they their share continues to decline at 14% of the total so if these three major cohorts of investors are all sort of divesting at the margins you know relative or the bare minimum not keeping up pace with the growth of you know public debts here in this economy that means the private sector has to pick up the slide so the private sector was 36% of the marketable treasury market back in late 2021 when we called for Bon yelds to materially accelerate uh to the upside as their function of the return of the treasury's uh net financing policy uh in 2022 so that's obviously something that that you know we were accurate impressioning on but you go look at that 36% uh percent ratio it's now up at 54% so the private sector investors now you know real real real money investors now own 54% of the marketable treasury market up from 36% uh just just a couple years ago and just the reason that's important David is because investors will demand higher yields to capitalize Uncle Sam we the private sector want return for the units of risk that we're taking in our portfolios we're not just GNA you know buy a treasury bond at any price like a foreign Central Bank would or a Commercial Bank would based based on you know changes in regulation Basel you know DOD Frank Etc or the Federal Reserve would if they're implementing a large scale asset purchase program and so that's in our view the FED has to do something to offset that and so we're going to see more currency to basement we're going to see more financial oppression by Banks uh of banks into the treasury market currently banks are uh 18% of their total assets are in Treasury and agency Securities when you do some ratio math you know because we don't have that time series going back as far you do some ratio math it was about 47% of commercial Banks Treasury and agency Securities back in the prior fourth turning so we know that number is going up we know the fed's balance Sheet's going to go up and we also know that foreign central banks depending on how this this geopolitical developments um uh geopolitical developments uh sort of uh progress throughout this for turning are probably not going to increase their share so as a function of all that then the def fed and and and and and and regulation that financially represses investors into the treasury market will have to accelerate marketly and all those things are incredibly bullish for risk assets okay and your U.S. Liquidity Situation Deep Dive Bas yeah and your base case assumption here flipping back to my screen on your notes Here your base case assumption is is that the US economy will remain resilient medium-term conviction well medium conviction rather uh the US economy remains resilient due to historically strong sector balance sheets you just talked about that uh to what extent would the war in the Middle East derail this uh thesis here yeah I mean look I'll say this and I don't mince you know words about this obviously we have a tragic situation what's going on you know across the middle you know across the all over the world obviously Russia Ukraine we all seem to forgot about that one as well uh what I've noticed throughout my career and my career began on global Wall Street at the depths of the financial crisis in 2009 uh the we've seen nothing but geopolitical uh uh consternation whether it be outright Wars deaths and Wars conflicts the the total amount of conflicts uh the headlines associated with conflicts those statistics have done nothing but go up and to the right throughout my entire career you know what else has gone up into the right through right my entire career the stock market Bitcoin gold so in my opinion you know a lot of the you got to focus on in my opinion you know this is our humble opinion and it's using my humble opinions to help thousands of investors around the world make tons of money you got to focus on the things that actually matter most to markets and so David to your point the way we would characterize uh the impact of a of an acceleration in the um conflicts that we're seeing with Israel and Iran by which by the way that conflict began a little bit over a year ago stock market's up 35% bitcoin's up like 150% Gold's up like 30% again it's not the conflict that matters it's how policy makers respond to the conflict Andor not even pay attention to the conflict at all um you you know so in our opinion how that will ultimately derail asset markets is through the lands of liquidity so we do we you know one of the things that we do in the context of our longer term views we obviously have to keep an eye on the Cycles we have the risk management Cycles so if you think about this just from a you know kind of um thinking about this from a secular standpoint we think the line is up and to the right with respect to risk assets however that does not mean we don't need to risk manage Cycles along the way they're plenty of Cycles to risk manage along the way and if if you're you know too long at the top of the cycle or not long enough at the bottom of the Cycles then the amount the total amount of return the total return you're going to face in these cycles and both on a sharp ratio basis and also on a nominal basis is going to be much lower than investors who are respecting those fluctuations and so we have to do a lot of you know research around where we are in the growth cycle the inflation cycle the liquidity cycle the policy Cycles to understand okay where are we are we here are we here in the context of this longer term structural bullish bi and so one of the things that we do uh to help investors understand that is is we do a lot of work on liquid what's happening with respect to uh the liquidity cycle and so you know when we talk about liquidity it's important for investors to know that if you don't have a informed view on liquidity it's probably a big detriment to your investing activity and how we Define liquidity here at 42 macro is the aggregated some of the world's major central bank balance sheets uh they brought money supply from those economies uh their FX reserves minus gold from those uh central banks and then we do we we run a bond market volatility overlay to account for uh fluctuations in in the repo Market which also have an impact on over the overall risk-taking that we see in financial markets and since the global financial crisis since 2007 risk assets have only corrected or crashed for two reasons uh either a declining liquidity or a refinancing air pocket which means that there wasn't enough liquidity for the previous issued uh debt around the world to get refinanced at appropriate rates until so you had a draw down in total non-financial sector debt so if you look at the black deadit lines and the so in this chart we show our Global liquidity proxy that's the Blue Line S&P 500 is the line uh the uh total non financial sector debt is the is the Shaded area and the black bed lines coincide with the big Corrections and crashes that we've um experienced as investors since uh the start of 2007 and every single one of them with the exception of bagdon coincided with a refinancing air pocket or a decline uh in global liquidity or both and so it's our view that you know if you're going to have the Middle East um the Middle East sort of uh the concentation that we're currently seeing in the Middle East if that deteriorates to an all out war between is and Iran that that won't be the issue what will be the issue is that we're going to have a refinancing air pocket and a decline in in in liquidity and So currently if you look at our forecasting tools uh we understand what the key leading indicators of liquidity are with respect to a three and six-month lead it's stocks it's crypto it's the US dollar it's FX volatility it's interest rates it's bond market volatility it's growth inflation unemployment and so we at all times here 42 Macro for our clients we're maintaining this model and refreshing this model to help them understand where is liquidity likely headed over the medium term and we do this by taking the sum of the correlation adjusted zc scores of those variables and subtracting the current zcore of where our liquidity proxy is and if there's a positive residual or significantly positive residual then we'll have a view that liquidity is likely to increase significantly over the medium term or vice versa and right now we are in the view that liquidity is going to continue to Trend higher over the medium term right now if you look at all the major economies in the world uh the global liquidity is trending higher Australian liquidity is trending higher Canadian liquidity is trending higher Canada or Chinese liquid is trending higher and it's going to accelerate meaningfully in the coming months EUR own liquidity is trending higher India's liquidity is trending higher Japan's liquidity is trending higher Swiss liquidity and UK liquidity is trending higher the only countries where liquidity is not currently trending higher is the US uh and Brazil and so if you think put that put this you know snapshot together with what's already currently happening then you can kind of wind up in a place where the only way this could derail things is if we actually have H you know significant pullback on some of those drivers of liquidity like the dollar gets stronger in fixed income volatility acceler and so you have to have a more informed view on what could potentially cause that how Bitcoin & Currency Debasement are you measuring liquidity is it uh Bank lending um money movements Capital flows great yeah so it's it's a little bit of all those three things so it's it's so we you know we take a step back we think liquidity comes from different sectors of the economy it's not just all coming from central banks it's not all coming from uh uh you know the private sector commercial Banks it's not all coming from the repo Market it comes from all all three actors so how we measure liquidity in the context of our uh uh you know 42 macronet the global liquidity proxy which again is the Blue Line in this chart here that is the aggregated sum of all those central bank balance sheets that we just uh walked through it's the aggregated share of their or aggregated sum of their uh uh broad money supply which we walked through and it's the aggregated FX reserves minus gold because obviously a lot of those FX reserves get recycled uh in into um into liquidity instruments and they they they reduce the burden of net financing uh for uh for for private sector investors which allows them that that frees up capital for them to go elsewhere and so you know one of the things that I think could potentially cause an issue in the context of our sanguin medium-term outlook for asset markets through the lens of the Israel Iran conflict or any other many conflicts that are currently going on that none of us are talking about right now because quite frankly they don't really matter to asset markets and again this is a program to help investors figure out where asset markets headed uh uh you know so those things if you think about what could potentially cause that is how will this impact the US dollar how will this impact us rates because those are the shortest those are the most reactive things that would cause an inflection a significant inflection on liquidity starting with the dollar here if you get the dollar right you're probably going to get the general direction and trend of liquidity right IE if you're right on the medium-term outlook for the US dollar you're probably going to get the medium-term outlook for us liquidity right or for Global liquidity right that's not always the case but it's generally the case and the reason for that is the dollar is a significant uh influence over global financing activity you know dollar is you know 60% of FX reserves it's 60% of crossb Bank lending it's 70% of interational Deb Securities uh Market it's 79% of trade invoices it's an 88% of Foreign Exchange transactions and 99% of stable coin backing and so how a weak dollar would so how let's assume your your sort of your question is um kind of leading us to the same place which is let's assume that we did have a significant pullback in asset markets as a function of the Israel Iran conflict you know how would that actually what would be the mechanism for that for that to occur it would obviously result in investors thinking that there's more inflation in the system system therefore pricing out uh the scope of rate cuts that are currently priced in US dollar money markets that would strengthen the dollar and cause the supply and demand for global crossb financing to decline right the supply goes down because the borrowers their creditworthiness declines because their currencies are declining against the dollar the supply the demand goes down because the credit the currencies are declining and it's a harder to service the debt so that takes out uh one pocket of liquidity from the private sector then obviously you have foreign central banks probably unable to price in as many rate cuts into their forward rate curves speak you know with forward guidance into their forward rate curves that obviously causes that um to unwind as well and then you probably have decline in global trade as a function of businesses and consumers getting incrementally concerned about the outlook for the global economy and so you sort of have a inverse of what we're calling for we're calling for all those things to be moving in the positive direction as they have been for the past year plus uh but we ultimately see that uh there is a risk to your point David that that those things stop but we're not forecasting them the stop we're not going to you know you know kind of Base our investment decision- making on you know what we is likely to happen to the Israel round War okay on the issue of uh the US liquidity situation declining that's interesting um I'm going like to drill in a little bit deeper on that let me just show you this chart first unrealized this is from the FDIC website un realize gains and losses on investment Securities this is um uh share of long longer term loans Securities 49.6% in uh first quarter of 2024 down 51% anyway you can see here held maturity security and available for cell Securities all underwater uh and they have been ever since 2022 in fact this is uh the in nominal terms the most amount of unrealized gains or losses rather uh ever far worse in 2008 I I don't know if this is significant at all but uh just by looking at this I'm assuming or I'm guessing that banks are more unwilling to lend if a larger amount of the Securities held for matur are not doing well yeah no to me this is the most bullish chart of macro really yeah yeah absolutely because both what it means is that the the policy makers it stopped the policy makers dead in their tracks back in 2023 I mean that's what it did I mean you go back to the UK guilt crisis and Falls 2022 where essentially we had a significant VAR VAR shock in the in the UK guilt Market that caused the bank of England completely reverse course in their policy this the VAR shock that we had across commercial Banks and the the Regional banking crisis last year essentially caused the FED to reverse course on its policy with its forward guidance obviously they got one more rate cut uh rate hike done from there but the markets had already inflected if you look at the slope of the US money market curves from that point and so this is in our opinion these Pro it's how the policy makers deal with these problems that creates the outcomes in asset markets and obviously with respect to the FED we got the btfp we got the doish forward guidance we got Jay now pivoting from I want to see pay to I want to see soft Landing this was all in in part and parcel in response to uh this this issue because at the end of the day what's what we're Happ we're observing around the world is very clear and cogent evidence of central Bankers prioritizing Financial stability over economic outcomes particularly o over their price stability mandates and as long as that's the case you you you cannot sit there and and and be in defensive assets that are going to get eroded away by inflation there there likely to be a sustained fund flow dynamic in support of risk assets and gold Bitcoin gold stocks all those types of assets that are you know not nominal and not tethered down to uh the US Treasury Market or global global Bond markets in our opinion it's this is bullish because the the policy makers are responding with doish policy okay so let's turn over now to uh the China stimulus story just today actually on Tuesday uh it was announced that um the government officials met I think the night before and they dis appointed Chinese investors with with lack of additional stimulus yeah can I before we go to China I there's one more thing I want to point out sure yeah please in the context of this conversation we were just having if you go so if you look at uh us liquidity so we were talked about global liquidity prior uh Global quid is currently trending higher and we're expected to continue trending higher you know obviously if we get you know some news that that could cause an inflection in that they we'll have to re respond in a basian manner which is why I do my job six six days a week but anyway so uh getting into um us liquidity so how we track US liquidity which is basically how the world tracks it now we we actually invented uh the the whole concept of net liquidity which is the Fed balance sheet minus the treasury General count balance minus the reverse loal facility balance that had been in persistent decline all the way through the end of 2022 uh and really into the early part of 2023 it's been flat since then despite the fact that the FED has continued its quote unquote quantitative tightening program and the reason it's been flat since then P for two reasons one primarily because we've had a significant decline uh in the RRP but why have we had a significant decline in the RP it's because you go back to the early part of 2023 which is what we talked about uh in terms of the fed's reaction to the regional banking crisis from that point forward the Ford rate curves for the US money markets were negatively sloped IE investors were pricing in rate cuts and rate cuts and rate cuts on a go four basis and so in our opinion those rate cuts that were being priced in the four curve obviously uh was you know supportive of the the returns that we've seen since then in in the bond market uh and and the inversion in the yield curve and so the doish policy or at least investors expecting doish policy and ultimately the FED ratifying that with its actual words and actual policy have been one of the key Reasons Why Us liquidity has stabilized despite the fed's quantitative tightening program and ultimately when you get into the first quarter of next year as a function of the debt selling negotiation process the debt selling moror lapses on January 1st as a function of what's likely to be a relatively lengthy dead sing negotiation process if we're right on our call for uh divided government then you're probably going to have a significant draw down in the treasury general comp balance as well which is also supportive of the liquidity supportive of us liquidity the same way that the decline significant decline in the RP balance was as well so again this is sort of the the the the environment the economic environment does not necessarily mean to scream bullish it's the policy makers's response to the economic environment that we need to be most aasted of as investors and why we continue to be uh relatively on the medium term out for asset markets sorry okay so so then let's actually sum up your your outlook Bullish Sectors & S&P 500 Outlook on US market so you're bullish on what exactly stocks bonds all the above yeah no uh definitely not Bonds I mean we we made the call going back to um September 17th to get out of the long Bine as a function of our medium-term views on the economy and how policy makers are going to uh perpetuate that with you know incrementally duag policy you know right now the FED is cutting interest rates into a late cycle expansion that does not need policy support and so what it's likely to do is cause both growth uh to growth to continue surprising to the upside which is are currently already baked into our forecast and it's likely to cause inflation to start to grind higher over the medium term so in our opinion that's very negative that's a higher than expected nominal GDP environment which is what we've uh what we're calling for on a on a next 12 month forecast Horizon basis that in our opinion is very unlikely to be supportive for bonds however it is likely to be supportive for stocks and other risk assets particularly in the backdrop of us and Global liquidity accelerating marketly in the first quarter of next year we do know that the fet funds rate is going to come down either way what is the relationship between the short end of the curve the long end yeah well I mean in our opinion there's not a tremendous linkage um from our perspective what we've seen throughout this business Cycles we've seen massive fluctuations in what was priced into from a four rate curve perspective U both both to the upside and to the downside but what's really driving the boat in our opinion is what we see here on slide 37 you know ever since we offed our us Brazilian use economy theme back in you know the fall of 2022 real economic growth has persist generally and persistently surprise consensus expectations to the upside when you look at our forecast we're expecting that Dynamic to continue and so ultimately we don't think what matters with we think the FED should continue to frontload policy rate easy because they will increase the probability that Jay gets the soft Landing that he wants and ultimately we think that what that is what he wants as a legacy to be as an investor but as a investor that doesn't me you need to be long bonds what we're essentially saying is the economy is fine the labor Market's fine you don't need to run out and buy a bunch of bonds in fact investors probably bought way too many bonds going back to when we told them to sell them a month ago okay do you have a target for the S&P 500 for us no no we're institutional investors we don't have price targets okay about whatever return we get throughout the duration of the the market move is is the return we get we're not going to tell the market what it has to do for us I only have one question on China uh and where I was going with China is that the stimulus package that was announced it was immediately bullish for Commodities particularly based medals uh now if base medals continue to rally on the back of more stimulus by the way they fell today because the stimulus measures announced last night failed to meet his festor expectations so the CSI in China and the Hang felt the Hang had his worst a since 2008 today um very very fickle Market over in China but anyway my point is if the base models do continue to Rally that could in theory feed into inflation is that is an input cost for a lot of things including construction uh does that transmission mechanism make sense to you China stimulus bullish for inflation across the board not just for China uh yes but we we've had a view on inflation that inflation is unlikely to return durably to Trend absent recession since January of 2022 so what China is doing is only supportive of that view go back to that fundamental research summary that you put up at the beginning you know so that's our oldest uh research theme that we've been operating here as as investors of 42 macro and the core tenant of the theme is that when you go back and you study business Cycles here in the US economy what we find is that uh two things one inflation Final Thoughts on the Fourth Turning is the most laging indictive business cycle it typically does a break down durably below Trend uh you know until well until recession and number two there is no historical evidence of it breaking down durably below Trend prior to recession so on a median basis it doesn't do that and then if you go back and you look at every observation in the sample and every postp business cycle that we've had in the US economy we've never seen inflation you know we've never seen the FED win on inflation without a recession and so it's our view that the FED has a choice to make and we we would argue the FED has already made the choice the FED has made the choice that it wants Financial stability it wants a smooth functioning in the treasury market which obviously the regional banking crisis was the shot across the bow to tell them that they need to do something different um they want smooth function in the treasury market and that is more important unfortunately for the folks like myself who you know like I used to be on the bottom part of the K the folks on the bottom part of the K unfortunately that means we're going to have to deal with higher inflation and this is something that Neil talked about uh in your conversation David uh uh with you about how historically how how how have we financed how have we capitalize how's governments capitalized the big you know changes in fiscal policy that typically occur in four turning they do it one of two way one of three ways currency to basement borrowing and taxes well currency to basement in in the um in the borrowing you know the the FED has you know kind of one and a half you know kind of units in that the fiscal policy is obviously the the fiscal Authority and we continue to see populace fiscal policy that will be accelerated in the coming uh decade but the fed's responsibility in that is to make sure that we are comfortable buying a treasury bond with an real interest rate that is you know negative potentially deeply negative as we progress throughout this fourth tourn uh good segue final part of our conversation Curren CD Baseman you told me Offline that uh your theoretical ideal asset allocation model would be 60% stocks 30% fixed income 5% cash and 5% Bitcoin let's drill down in the 5% Bitcoin because we talked about the other assets how does that 5% Bitcoin allocation fit into your currency de basement thesis yeah so that's a great question so it's actually 60310 you know that's our kind of flag that's that is our Flagship investment strategy that we use to help retail investors remain on the right side of Market race we use a separate systematic strategy for our Institutional Investor clients but with respect to our kidol construction process so that is a 60310 trend following strategy that is designed to essentially out materially outperform 6040 over the long term if you think about the average any return of our kiss process it's right around 15% with a Max draw down is 12% for calar ratio average return divided by Max draw down of 1.3 if you look at 6040 the average return of 6040 is all way down at 10% with a with the max R down of minus 22% so the calar ratio there is only 0.4 so I think you know kiss is doing its job in terms of keeping clients you know in the market participating in this you know monetary debasement regime that began back in 2008 uh we continue to see evidence of that monetary debasement regime not only accelerating domestically in the context of our J1 the self Landing theme uh the that by the way cut cut the policy rate 50 basis points with core inflation 70 basis points above Target uh last month so investors I think it's we continue to get evidence of that of that theme uh you know we we're we're trying to do is keep investors invested in the market while also you know using our core RIS Management Systems to you know kind of help them step aside heading into bare markets so that they can preserve capital and actually have money to invest when we get to the lows of those Cycles again and that's exactly what we're observing right now so that 5% allocation in Bitcoin is just a function of the bottom up per management overlay taking down the exposure to bitcoin from 10% to 5% directly again this is a trend following strategy so it's a you know we're proud of it very very good uh Darius this was a great talk so overall constructive on the economy and on risk assets um any sectors in particular let's close off here any sectors in particular within the S&P 500 that you are the most bullish on yeah so great question so we are currently in a uh Goldilocks Market regime so this is our discretionary risk management overlay table this is what we this the tool that we use to help institutional investors pick factors long short and weight those uh uh bets and so right now we're in a Goldilocks Market regime to Key portfol Construction considerations in a go loss Market regime specifically as it relates to equities are you generally want to belong High beta equities over low beta equities you want to belong cyclicals over defensives you want to belong growth over value you want to belong small mid caps over large caps that's s generally how you want to be invested as an investor in Gold loocks so with respect to you know some of the sectors that we like the most that have broken out most recently that probably have more UPS side from here are things like energy things like Industrials on the sector side it's things like midcaps small caps High beta on the factor side and it's and Global equities um not Global equities broadly emerging market equities China em India those types of equities have historically performed quite well in this context of a Goldilocks Market regime I mean it's it doesn't feel like Goldilocks from an economic standpoint David but if you think about what's happening in the economy we have a Slowdown in growth that is surprising the upside I mean that kind of sounds like you know the three little bears story you know it's not too hot it's not too cold and as a function of that and theed is obviously aing AB betting that with monetary policy cutting interest rates providing dubish forward guidance that probably going to slow the pace of fake qt in the coming months as well if they're unable to push through more rate Cuts in the first part of next year as a function of the economy proving resilient and inflation starting to firm up again okay good Darius thank you very much for your analysis uh where can we learn more from you can we follow 42 macro well I appreciate you David man thanks again for having me on your show and all the best to you and your viewers uh so you can come check us out at 42 macro as you can see you know we're very data driven shop you know I cut my teeth on the global the institutional meeting around flying around the world meeting with institutional investors uh you know kind of learning a lot of these procedures and processes and we're trying you know we're really proud of democratizing this for Main Street you know this is something that as I said I grew up on the bottom part of the K in this economy and I want to be be able to take the the blessing of of of the gift of math that I've been blessed with and and actually you know create tools and solutions for you know Main Street and in addition to uh the folks on Wall Street so we're really grateful for that that's at 42 macro.com okay put the link down below so make sure to follow Darius there um just curious because you said you you know you basically told him as you grew up poor now you're not um David well we congratulate you you're a success story on your own um if that's the case so give the glory to God my friend the uh the education system in the do you think we're lacking or even in Canada as well do you think we're lacking uh Financial education in public schools oh that's a I mean we can go on a rabbit hole on this topic but absolutely I mean you know I kind of have a you know 10 for hat view that they don't want us to know this stuff you know at some point I'll probably fly too close to the Sun and the wind up missing I'm guessing you didn't learn Advanced economics in school in high school right when did you start becoming acquainted with this subject I mean I went to Y so I mean I I I did start learning so you know at some Point yeah okay after high school all right yeah but no I agree with you David I do think there's an education crisis in this country and that's why and I my opinion I think it's so important for folks like us with platforms to you know generate the interest and generate the support for fixing that problem and it may be one of the problems that we fix in the four turning but unfortunately as our friend Neil I would like to say we probably have to go through the path of predition before we get to the to the good good part do you feel like just final question will'll close off follow 42 macro in the link down below do you feel like we are entering the fourth throning right now uh just from your own personal perspective anecdotes that you've observed in your own life yeah no there's a a personal perspective uh no I mean sitting there looking at the the forest miles and miles of forest so it's beautiful my life is great but uh no from a from a from a e purely economics standpoint from a statistical standpoint if you go back and like we said with that deep dive empirical study that we' done I mean there's probably 35 different time series that we've analyzed statistically to investors understand what's likely to happen with the economy what's like to happen with monetary policy fiscal policy geopolitics socio economic developments and for turning and if you look at how things have progressed since 2008 in this country and really around the world as well we are sort of tracking right along you know Trend and so we have a very high conviction that we are a in a for turning and B the for turning crisis will deepen in the coming years and as a function of that we want to make sure investors are participating in asset markets or exposed to asset markets with the appropriate Solutions in their portfolio so that they can take care of their families in this um in this was likely to be an increasingly trying time thanks very much again Darius and thank you for watching don't

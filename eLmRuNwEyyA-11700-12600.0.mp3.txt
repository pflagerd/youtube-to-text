burn a hole into the muscle of the upper arm just like you would take a cigarette and burn a hole into your arm and then they pack this hole with this material from the underbelly of this frog and then a spectacular trip results but this is entirely the reports of one field worker which it's a dream come true for him this is what we all want to do is go off and find a powerful hallucinogen that nobody else knows anything about and and then bring it back so that's a case of that here's a question not terribly relevant but I like talking about my friends can you talk a little about your association with Rupert Sheldrake Rupert is a good friend of mine he and Ralph Abraham and I are writing a book together he's the morphogenetic field man and this is an alternative hypothesis to the scientific hypothesis one way of thinking about psychedelics and I didn't mention it because I didn't want to have to sketch you Sheldrake's cosmology but since the question was asked one way of thinking about psychedelics is they amplify the morphogenetic field we see then what connects whatever you're looking at whatever you're looking at then you see what is connected because the morphogenetic field which is there all the time but which is sort of mitigated against by our language habits becomes suddenly visible and then my time wave which I've strictly avoided talking about today is an effort on my part to actually write an equation for the Sheldrake and morphogenetic field and you see Rupert's idea is not that powerful until somebody can walk to any blackboard and write the equations for the morphogenetic field until that's done he's in the position that James Clerk Maxwell was in vis-a-vis the electromagnetic field until somebody then James Clark Maxwell in this case figured out the inverse square law and what the constraints were and then wrote the equations of electromagnetic radiation could you elaborate further on the nature of MAO inhibitors I will since I mentioned it and it's worth understanding it's that mono a means are these simple chemical compounds that are very active in biological systems including all the drugs we've been talking about and many drugs we haven't mentioned these are all mono a means well then you have a system in the body called monoamine oxidase the ace on the end of a word indicates you're dealing with an enzyme transcript a but this is monoamine oxidase it's it oxidizes mono a means it makes them harmless byproducts so if you take a drug one of these mono a means it is monoamine oxidase that will render it harmless and shunt it to your urine but there are what are called monoamine oxidase inhibitors and that means that if you take the MIO inhibitor now the monoamine oxidase can't destroy the monoamine and the mono a means accumulate and you get high that's what happens and and sometimes monoamine accumulation can be a self-generated toxic state where for some reason toxic byproducts aren't breaking down then they will give you on monoamine oxidase to oxidize these products away but it's a reasonable strategy to try and jam the monoamine oxidase machinery to allow an exogenously introduced mono a mean to then accumulate to intoxicating levels so it's just a pharmacological strategy where does one obtain high-quality cubensis spore prints or cultures well I mentioned my brother and I wrote a book on growing psilocybin mushrooms you can order it out of the catalogs that are at the front there's an ad in the back of that book for high-quality spore prints and a company called syzygy will send you a little plate of glass with more spore prints on it than there are people in North America our North American cubensis mushrooms do they have lower potency and can this be overcome by selective breeding selective breeding of mushrooms is an excruciating task first of all you have to be able to work with a microscope powerful enough that you can push one spore against another keeping a third spore out of the picture what people call breeding is where you inoculate to a plate to separate strains and where the two growing edges meet you cut a square out of that and osterize it and then re-inoculate but that's not really selective breeding our North American cubensis mushrooms lower in potency yes they are apparently equatorial heat has something to do with the production of psilocybin say something about San Pedro cactus as a psychedelic agent this is one of the ones that sort of got left out of the survey this morning because I was ripping right along this is a very large columnar cactus that grows on the northeast coast of Peru and contains mescaline just like the peyote cactus and it has been used for a long long time we have pottery out of Peru three thousand third millennium BC of this of this San Pedro cactus it's a very powerful shamanic agent Marion Woodman who I guess spoke to you recently has stated one of the most noteworthy archetypes to surfeit us in recent analysis and dreams is the black Madonna a blending of mother and whore energies would you comment on this in the light of your psychedelic experiences and the re-emergent of the feminine energy well I think you know the goddess is on the move the goddess is this archetype is drawing energy with the fury that has not been seen since the Angervine court of Eleanor of Aquitaine and it's a re-imaging of deity that is going on at every level and certainly on psychedelics you have immense moving experiences of the goddess if you invoke the goddess and in that situation you can confront her this is all part of this archaic return I mean it's happening on many levels and imaging the supreme power of the universe as feminine boundary lists penetrating is very important let me say just a bit about gender politics because sometimes people think I have no use for men when you look at human beings against the background of the rest of nature we are all so yang that the struggle between the masculine and the feminine is not something that should be fought out between the two varieties of human beings a proper reconnection to the feminine would be a reconnection to the vegetable matrix this is the passive in folding caring bearing matrix of life on the earth and all animal life comes off as tremendously young regardless of its sexual expression so I think we do have work to do on gender relationships between men and women but more than that we all have a great deal of re-feminizing to do vis-a-vis the living earth does one need a shaman guide in order to enter the world of sacred plants is there a danger in working with sacred plants without a shaman does one need a shaman guide in order to enter the world of sacred plants this is the question of the sitter you know if you're going to experiment with these things should you have someone sit with you I think in the name of prudence the answer has to be yes at least the first time I'm a little uncomfortable giving that advice because I don't like sitters they hold me at the surface and they I just if there's a person around that's what I end up thinking about I want to get everybody out of the way so that I can make a very clean deep plunge to where I'm going and I don't want any witnesses because one of the things that happens in psychedelic states is often you're going through something you're totally ecstatic but the presentation of it is crisis-like you're there you are you're on the ground covered with dirt moaning screaming and and she said so are you all right is something wrong and the answer is no nothing's wrong everything is fine but the the person who has the expectations of the culture of what means right and wrong will bring you down with their and this is why remember in in scenarios the Soledad when Jose Arcadia born Dia chained himself to the tree this is a good technique I've done this I've chained myself to a tree so that I would not present a problem to myself and then I took it with perfect confidence all by myself because I knew I couldn't get away from my tree although maybe I could fall out of my tree is there a danger in working with sacred plants without a shaman well I suppose the New Age answer is certainly my answer is no less danger than there is working with a shaman I would say I mean you gotta watch these shamans you know they're a fairly beady eyed lot it it is the archetype of the trickster don't forget that I mean the notion that this is just some open-hearted little forest fellow who wants to tell you all his hard-won secrets I mean that's a assumption of course you don't want to go too far the other way I always have I find over and over in the Amazon when I'm off with these people we come to the place where now we've taken the ayahuasca or whatever it is and I'm sitting across the fire looking at this guy and I realize you know we're four days up this river in two days down this trail and and then I realized with perfect certainty that they're going to kill me right there that evening this you have to have a chat with yourself about this kind of thing well ahead of time because you must be able to discipline your hindbrain your hindbrain is always telling you crazy stuff to blow your focus and you just have to say no no he's not going to kill me and even if he tried I'm bigger than he is so you know and work your way out but this thing of cross-cultural shamanism I don't really know what to do with it I see the shamans noble souls brought from the Peruvian jungles and they they do not do well in these cultures we don't understand what a corrosive force we are we don't understand what an air ticket to Paris means to somebody who's never been to the big town at the bottom of the river and we tend to hold things so close to our chest that we smother them I think it would be a good idea to leave the shamans in the jungle and if it's so damn important to you to spend time with them then bite the bullet go go there go to them I mean what kind of spiritual quest is this where we fly the teacher in to a waiting group of psychopaths how are we doing oh we're not doing so well that was the last question folks well let me I'll smooth the gaff by by saying this is important and it may sound like fluff but it isn't we look exactly like everybody else to most people and we will now leave this hall and disappear back into our lives but you might take a moment this is your affinity group it's preposterous demeaning and unhealthy to focus on one person you know the Terence McKenna the Tim Leary the John Lilly I mean

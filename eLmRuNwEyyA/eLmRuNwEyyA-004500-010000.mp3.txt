a bunch of these things and laid in a supply and But it is an occult watery It's a dimension of confusion not a dimension of high awareness and I think some of you have heard me tell the story about the reason I gave it up was an Englishman a friend of mine who lived in this little village in Nepal where I lived he was also Experimenting with this stuff one day. I was buying potatoes and tomatoes in the market And I ran into him and we started having a conversation and in the course of the conversation He revealed that he believed we were in his apartment And then I knew That you know we weren't we were losing hold on our grounding So I don't recommend that I don't have a whole lot to say about it. Apparently. It's a it's a thing for magic Power magic and I've never been particularly interested in that because I'm afraid of it. I'm I'm a watcher. I like to look I like to get very close to it and watch it, but I'm not into Grabbing it or doing anything with it. I I have a feeling that would lead to catastrophe for me personally Okay Okay, where are we now northern Mexico now we've gone all around we started in Europe We went down into Africa across the Eurasian continent North America and northern Mexico now things get interesting Because as you leave the Sonoran uplands and go south in the Sierra Mazatec It is this mushroom complex which Valentina and Gordon Watson Discovered in the 1953s 17 to 22 species it depends on who's counting of extremely endemic meaning very localized species of mushrooms all producing psilocybin a coincident with the Mayan the cultural side of the Mayan mixtec and Mazatec and civilizations and this is psilocybin an Extraordinarily powerful visionary and benign hallucinogenic metabolite once the Watsons Had nailed down this Mexican mushroom complex then people started checking and they discovered these mushrooms or conspecific species in many localities To that are worth mentioning are the Pacific Northwest Oregon Washington and British Columbia which appears to be the world's center for species density of the psilocybin gene and strangely enough a very good Ethnographic research turns up. No hint that these qua cutel shimsham Tlingit and other people had any hint of this they lived in the center of the psilocybin Distribution complex and as far as we can tell their shamanism, which was highly evolved never discovered or made use of this not so these civilizations of Mesoamerica the other place where these mushrooms have now been discovered and the range seems to be extending every year is Europe The tragedy of European civilization is that the logos was apparently there all the time? The English countryside I understand is now practically a scene of annual mushroom runs that are not unlike the lemming runs of Scandinavia and everybody pours out to to collect the semi Lanciata Mushrooms the I've been told I haven't been to these sites, but I've been told that Ionia where the book of Kells was composed and where St. Columba went is covered with mushrooms. It's very clearly any mushroom ecology attention graduate students the tracing of mushroom motifs in European art and Civilization and culture is an extremely rich untapped field If you need some clues Look at family escutcheons look at family crests In France in France and the Italian parts of France the Morelli family Has the morale on their? Escutcheon there are other mushroom families and mushroom names So there may have been you know, this may have been the struggle between paganism and Christianity may have revolved Around a mushroom. We know Druids were into plants. We know they were into oak groves but The plant that is always mentioned as the druidic psychedelic psychic plant of choice is mistletoe but mistletoe is chemically very disappointing and I've wondered if mistletoe is not It wasn't the plant they wanted to symbolize they wanted to symbolize the symbiosis of one plant upon another It's that the mistletoe symbolizes epiphytic existence Anyway, this is an untapped area Once you get into the New World tropics, then you are in the great domain of of the hallucinogenic plants and no one knows Why it is that the tropics of the New World are? tremendously rich in Hallucinogens, I mean, I don't know how many of you are botanists or or biologists, but try to imagine Figuring out a set of evolutionary constraints that were operating on one side of the planet but not on the other, you know when we take for instance the jungles of Southern Columbia and Compare them with let us say the jungles of New Guinea. These are both continental flora's both equatorial both climaxed at a species rich climax and One has dozens of hallucinogens in it and the other has none none This is not well understood, I mean theories range as wildly as obviously that South America must be where the Flying Saucer landed and You know, that's where the genes were seeded I Confess I'm not sure why it is At first I thought that it had to do with the extremely primitive state So-called primitive these extremely archaic state of culture in the South American jungles That they represent a real Stone Age culture where when you go into Indonesia it may look primitive to you, but the Dutch were there before the English arrived in North America It is it has had centuries and centuries for which in which these things could be forgotten But of course then come the botanists who care nothing for ethnographic data and who simply carry out plant surveys and chemical analysis of plants They can't find these hallucinogens either. So this is a great mystery in the tropics of the Mesoamerica and and The equatorial tropics of the New World. There's a vast Panoply of hallucinogens, not only the mushroom complex, but then also this ayahuasca or yahay Complex that we've referred to several times This is a huge jungle vine and as we cross into the yahay Area we also cross we we cross an interesting Barrier Because we move from plants single plants which are hallucinogenically active into the realm of Preparations we're on the threshold of the concept drug here because what ayahuasca is is two plants Which are not active unless brought into combination with each other one plant Contains a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and the other plant contains DMT Which would be destroyed in the gut if taken orally Unless it were taken orally in the presence of an MAO inhibitor Well, this was not understood by Western pharmacology until 1956 but it was understood by Amazonian shamans millennia ago so they bring these two things together and by varying the ratio between the plant containing the beta carbolenes that inhibit MAO and the plants that contain DMT they can intensify or De-emphasize the visions well, most of the Most of the hallucinogens in the Amazon Basin run on tryptamine of some sort usually DMT in the upper Basin of Colombia Ecuador Peru like that you get these banisteria these Yahe ayahuasca Beverages these are things you drink and then it comes on you have these outlandish trips as you go down Into the lower Basin the banisteriopsis cult gives way to these snuff cults Ibina and Neopo depending on the languages these are don't depend on an MAO inhibitor for their activity because they're absorbed through the sub nasal Mucosa, which is an extremely effective way for getting drugs Into the system the problem with these with that complex the snuff complex Is that we are just physically such delicate and wimpy? People that we can't stand that route route of drug Administration because what they do is they toast these seeds of an adenanthra Peregrina this huge leguminous tree, which is the source of the seeds they toast these seeds and powder them So what you get is a kind of rough cross between sawdust and charcoal and then they have a hollow tube about this long and they load it up with this stuff and You squat down and put the nostril the tube into your nostril and your friend your friend Not you because you would not do it hard enough your friend then takes a huge breath of air and And it's just like being hit in the face with a two by four I mean It's like being hit in the face and you fall over backwards you scream you salivate you squirm around there in the dirt for a minute or two and Then you sit back up and by that time the tube has been reloaded for the other nostril And then you know in your eyes your sinuses can't believe what's happening to you So you have to sort out this whole sinus Shock, which is going on in parallel within an evolving strange state of mind Which is beginning to take over and and clarify everything and then there are numerous minor variations on these things Might talk just a little bit about the chemistry of these things and the chemistry of hallucinogens generally my attitude toward these this question of plants compounds drugs Should these things be? used for spiritual growth If the answer is no then that finishes you don't have to go any further if the answer is maybe or yes, then other questions arise which compounds out of this whole survey and at what frequency and at what dosage and under what Circumstances and over the years I've sort of evolved a Three-way test that I will share with you because I think it's maybe them Operationally the most useful thing you'll hear this weekend, and that is if you are contemplating some Some compound some plant then the first thing to ask yourself is Does it occur in nature? Does it have some? Tangentiality to what is already existing because obviously what exists that's nature Has undergone some? vast winnowing process out of the set of all things which might Exist in that wonderful phrase of Alfred North whiteheads Certain things have undergone the formality of actually occurring you know and and and so certain certain compounds have undergone the formality of actually occurring in the biological matrix and so they should be they should be our pool out of which our Experimental compound should be drawn, but this is thousands of compounds. How can we further narrow it? Well an excellent way of narrowing

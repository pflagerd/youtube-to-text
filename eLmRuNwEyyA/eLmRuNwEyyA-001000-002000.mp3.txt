Macrobius and Dossetius and Dionysius the pseudo Areopagus and all those folks that you just never hear about it was my introduction to the under to the underbelly of Western civilization Was through Jung well To my mind and now I'll theme this in to today's theme I think Maria mentioned that Jung did not have a lot to say about shamanism he came to it late in his life, and he had already worked through the Massive the exegesis of the symbol systems of the European mind and so he was sort of content To indicate shamanism as an area where more work was to be done And then the great follow-on scholar was mercy Leod Who then actually? studied shamanism showed what its archetypal underpinnings were in all times and places and the combination of Jung and Iliad I think pretty much delivered us as firm a map of the psyche as Dependable a map of the psychic geography as we can expect to have until we make the trip ourselves and you know readjust the landscape with our own notes and Observations For for Jung the great path into the unconscious was alchemy and alchemy Is an interesting pivotal Domain Because I think we could in a way say it lies halfway between the concerns of an archaic shamanism and halfway between the concerns of a quasi scientific Psychedelic attempt to explore consciousness Mercy Leod wrote a brilliant book on alchemy called the forge and the crucible Which is the bridge to show you how you go from Jungian psychology? Into an understanding of alchemy that approximates Iliad the notion for the alchemists that Jung brought forth very strongly was the idea of projection of psychic contents projection of the active imagination onto processes and Objects in the exterior world in the case of the alchemists. It was the swirling chemical processes in their alembics in their alchemical vessels that they projected the The great round of the archetypes on to these chemical processes they saw crystallization sublimation proliferation as Statements about the contents of the psyche as much as statements about the exterior world Because for them the firm division between mind and matter The firm ontological division between mind and matter that is built into Western thinking now did not exist That comes with Rene Descartes with the invention of what's called the res extensa the Extended world and the res verins the interior world which has no spatial extension So for the alchemist mind and matter worth were two terms whose mutual Exclusivity could be blurred under certain circumstances and the terms of one could migrate Toward the other well now we as moderns Ordinarily only experience this state when we are intoxicated by Hallucinogenic drugs or when we are in a state of severe psychic weakness when there is then Overwhelmment from the unconscious that is not Not with the permission of the ego as happens in the psychedelic Experience well all of these various ways of approaching the psyche Seem fairly abstract and bloodless and removed from daily existence unless the psychedelic experience is Present and then it vivifies These metaphors it makes clear what these various perennial Traditions are talking about So what I thought I would try to do today and you're welcome to try and steer it other directions in the question-and-answer period is the the workshop is sacred plants as guides a lot of information has to be imparted if we're going to satisfy my pedagogical urge here Because I would really like to leave you with information that you didn't have before Some of which may have practical efficacy in in your own Life, so in thinking about this very large issue sacred plants as guides I basically break it down into three categories for ease of handling in a context like this and They are a kind of survey What how many of these plants are there? What are the chemicals that drive them and what is their geographical? distribution in other words just what are the botanical facts of the matter and then secondly I think in order to understand what these things mean for spiritual growth and Psychic development you have to place them in the context and the context is chronological and historical Have these things always been around have shamans always been taking them How do they relate to the synthetic drugs that have been developed in the last couple of centuries? so the history of our relationship to the Pharmacologically induced ecstasy and then finally and probably we'll get to this this afternoon the phenomenology of the experience and the techniques for achieving and controlling it because this is a Practical there is a practicum here. This is not a course in Mongolian Philology or something like that The ultimate idea is to get those who feel called to the task sufficiently informed and psychically empowered that they can push off Into the oceans of mind in the interior with some fair amount of confidence that they'll return to port with all hands So Let's start sort of with a survey. Let me see. I'm going to talk until 1130 so let's start with the survey then and just talk about what the options are and this will be sort of unstructured and conversational with forays into other areas first of all the striking thing when you want to study Psychoactive drugs and plants and their impact on human culture, and that's really what interests me Is how drugs affect culture? after I went through Jung and McLuhan and Iliad my next port of call was McLuhan and I absorbed very deeply the notion that media structure Civilizations in ways that the civilizations are never aware of and Jung of course talked about print and Manuscript and electronic culture. He did not talk about drugs but drugs are a form of media because they information travels through the drug to the mind that's a medium of communication and various societies wear drugs like clothing with no awareness of their existence at all somewhat in the way that a fish relates to Water so that for instance if you're in Dublin you are swimming in the ambience of an alcohol culture You don't have to be drunk to be in Dublin although it helps But the the entire society is premised on the possibility You see the entire society is premised on the possibility in India the entire society is premised on the possibility of hashish intoxication and social mores building design Everything takes account of this cultures. Don't see this. We do not think of ourselves as a meat sugar alcohol culture
